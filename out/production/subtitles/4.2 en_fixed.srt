00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Good afternoon dear students.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,300
Today our lecture will be devoted to time management.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,800
During several decades the main point of time management has been

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
considered in finding ways to do more things in less time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,700
But in the modern world the key value is not

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,100
intensity of our work, but the results we achieve.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,900
This requires us to organize our work in the most efficient way,

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,200
managing not only our time, but also our attention and energy.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
The very first step towards high performance is to determine tasks that

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,600
 we should invest our time, energy and attention in.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,700
What is actually important for you, does it correlate with your values, and will it lead you to your goals?

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Performing what tasks will influence your results the most?

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,000
There are a lot of tools for defining your priorities;

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
you may find information on them in this lecture’s extra material.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,400
Today I would like to familiarize you with perhaps the easiest, yet very effective, technique that is called “The rule of three”.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
The method consists of three steps:

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,200
Step 1: In the beginning of the day ask yourself:

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,400
“When this day is over, which three things I want to be done?”

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Step 2: Write them down

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Step 3: You should focus your attention on these three things during the whole day.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,200
- DO NOT include very little things in this list, but do not set undoable goals as well.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,800
- Along with such tasks as “Finish a chapter of my course project” or “Make a presentation”,

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,400
do not forget to include your personal things, such as meeting a friend or reading 30 pages of a novel.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,000
If they correlate with your values and bring you satisfaction, they should be in the list.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,500
So, we have determined WHAT should be done in the first place in order to achieve good results.

26
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,200
Now we should figure out AT WHAT POINT during the day we should do our priority things, and when - everything else.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Most likely you have noticed that your energy level fluctuates considerably during the day.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,000
One of the most powerful means of increasing your productivity is to get a clear understanding of your biological rhythm.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In this case you will have a chance to accomplish your tasks with maximum

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,500
efficiency when you have your biological peak and you are full of energy.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,500
A large research proved that our level of energy in different periods of the day not only

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,300
determines how easily we accomplish a task, but also how well we do it, our ability to be focused.

33
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:35,200
This is why we should choose carefully when to do things of different complexity and importance.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,700
Let’s have a look at the energy curve of an average person:

35
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,800
We start from biological peak:

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,100
it is the part of the day when we are bright and cheerful, have clear mind and high level of energy.

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,200
It is the best time for complicated analytical work,

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,300
requiring maximal focus of attention and ability to think critically.

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Then, usually after midday, level of energy starts to decrease,

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,300
the mood often sinks, and the signs of fatigue start to appear.

41
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,200
The best idea would be to give yourself a break to recharge your batteries,

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,400
but if you don’t have such opportunity, this time would be good enough for tackling technical tasks, such as

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,800
checking your inbox, making phone calls, checking your social media, google some information, and so on.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,100
Of course, what you should do and when do not depend on you completely.

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,600
But if you get such opportunity, you should choose respective

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,900
part of the day to deal with tasks of different importance and complexity.

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,800
As a result, you will experience considerable increase of your productivity.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Now I would suggest you to make a research that will let you analyze

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,600
effectiveness of your time management.

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,300
Enclosed you will find a table for timekeeping that will help you with several things at once:

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,200
- Firstly, it gathers statistics on your actual time use

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,900
- Secondly, it measures fluctuation of your energy level during the day

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,300
- Thirdly, it helps you to track accomplishment of your priority tasks.

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,400
Perhaps, you think that you already know how you spend your time.

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Trust me, after a week of keeping this diary you will be surprised.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,700
Monitoring your time and energy is a tiresome task, but the reward will be worth it.

57
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,600
In the end of each day answer the questions under the table.

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,700
Also, you should assess critically what you do during the day.

59
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,600
Perhaps, your day looked like a fire extinguishing and you just couldn’t

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,900
make it to the cherished three things?

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,500
Calculate how much time you spend on things with low or zero efficiency, such as

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
checking your social networks, chatting in messengers, watching series, and so on.

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Think which things of low efficiency you can and should say “no” to.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,200
Let’s recall the key recommendations of this lecture:

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,700
1. Analyze your values, needs and goals

66
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,800
2.  Define your priorities. Think which tasks will have the biggest effect on your results.

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,500
3.  Each morning write down three key goals for the day and be focused on them during the day

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,300
4.  Keep weekly tracking of your time and energy fluctuations during the day

69
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,600
5.  Determine periods of your biological peak and decline

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,300
6.  Deal with the most complicated and important tasks during your peak period

71
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,500
7.  Complete the tasks with low output in other periods

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,000
8.  Analyze your timekeeping table and take your findings about every previous day into account

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,600
9.  Calculate how much time you waste and say “no” to the most malicious “time-killers”

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,100
10.  Plan your time and do things deliberately.

75
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,135
See you at the next lecture!
