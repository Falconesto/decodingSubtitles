00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello! My name is Natalia Khokhlova

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and I am a lecturer for the course “Effective team management” at ITMO University

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and an experienced HR.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In this video I will present to you a brief overview of the section “Self-presentation”

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
within the online-course “Living in science: a young researcher's guide”.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My colleagues and I will tell you about the skills of self-presentation in this section

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
such as business communication and business correspondence.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In the video lecture “Ethics of the business communication” 

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we will learn about how to correctly choose the communication channel

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
in order to address your issues more effectively and to reach your objectives.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We will find out what basic rules and principles of business communication

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
true professionals should stick to 

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and what typical mistakes should be avoided. 

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We will surely prepare 

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
a competent curriculum vitae together, which is your professional business card.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We will also discuss how to prepare for and properly pass an interview 

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to surely get the job of your dreams that best suits your needs. 

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In video lectures, dedicated to public speaking skills,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we will talk about how to make speech in public, how to prepare for it,  

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
how to cope with anxiety before and during the performance.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We will talk about the goals of the presentation, target audience, genres and structure of the speech.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You will learn about nonverbal components of the speech such as voice, 

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
mimic, gestures, hands, and so on. 

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In the lecture “Technique of answering questions” we will discuss

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
how to communicate with the audience after your presentation.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We will find out how to answer questions, including the provocative and trick ones, 

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
how to respond to the criticism and how to answer questions you don't know the answers to for some reason.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In this same section “Self-presentation” we will deliberate 

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
on such an interesting process as networking.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In simple terms, it’s about creating a circle of professionals around you 

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and building relationships with people in a way 

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that you will always be able to ask them for advice, 

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
promote some of your projects or ideas 

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and to get some useful information in general. 

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My colleagues and I would be happy to share our knowledge,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
skills and abilities in the field of self-presentation with you.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We are sure that this information would be useful in your professional life and beyond.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
See you in our video lectures!
