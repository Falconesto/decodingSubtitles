00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,120
Hello!

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
My name is Oleg Borisov.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,299
In previous lectures, my colleague
Inna Anokhina discussed

4
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,951
what publications are, their
structure and the rules of

5
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:09,951
writing articles.

6
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:13,410
In this and following
lectures, you will learn about

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,950
a very convenient
tool for preparing articles –

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,950
the LaTeX publishing
system.

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,360
I will speak about the principles of
working with this system, the main concepts

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,780
and the structure of the source files.

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,980
The basis of this tool is
the TeX desktop

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,920
publishing system, created by American
mathematician and software

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,119
engineer Donald
Knuth for typesetting of

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,230
texts with mathematical
formulas.

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,559
Later on, another American scientist
Leslie Lamport developed

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,010
his own macro-
definition package based on

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,109
this system and
named it LaTeX.

18
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,980
This macro-definition package is

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,980
still popular.

20
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,809
To start working with the LaTeX 
system you will need

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,140
to install three components onto your
computer. The first component is the

22
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,569
TeX distribution corresponding
to the operating system (notably,

23
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:58,640
the cross-platform nature
of this tool is

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,499
its undoubted advantage);
The second is the LaTeX

25
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:05,770
file editor (Although you can
work with files in any text

26
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,410
editor, it is convenient
to use special programs

27
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,350
with syntax
highlighting provided)

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,460
the final component - is to install
a program for viewing PDF files.

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,400
Now a couple of words about the
principle of working with the system.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,580
There are well-known
editors of the

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,440
“get what I see” type, in which the
process of preparing the document

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,570
involves working directly
with the final file. For example,

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,850
editing is performed in parallel
with viewing the result.

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,290
In the LaTeX system, working with a
document (its source file)

35
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,130
and viewing the final
file are two different

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,930
operations, performed sequentially.

37
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,200
First, the source file
is compiled in tex format.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,530
It includes the content of the
document, as well as

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,320
the command set that
define how the text

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,530
should look like.

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,110
After compilation, the file
of the final document is

42
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,720
generated in PDF format with
the required formatting.

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,480
On the one hand, this principle
will require initial training,

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,890
as it involves prior knowledge 
of the commands and possession

45
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,030
ofsystem syntax, but
on the other hand, it

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,650
significantly speeds up
the layout process.

47
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,319
Next, let us consider
what the source

48
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,319
file is. It consists

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,950
of two parts – the preamble
and the body of the document.

50
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,319
The preamble sets up
different packages, overriding,

51
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,370
settings, options
that affect

52
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,629
the entire document.

53
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,769
The body contains the content
of the document in

54
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,209
accordance to the system syntax.

55
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,629
When working with the source
file, as noted above, it is

56
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,569
necessary to operate
on various commands.

57
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,930
They are declared through the
backslash character followed by

58
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,719
the name of the command without
spacing.

59
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,489
For some commands, it is necessary
to specify arguments, which

60
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,030
can be mandatory
and indicated

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,639
in braces
or indicated 

62
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,030
in square brackets.

63
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,060
For example, the first command
starting the preamble

64
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,329
of the source tex
file is as follows.

65
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,080
It determines the
style of the document.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,220
Notice the backslash
character, the name of

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,510
the command, and the mandatory
argument – “article” specified

68
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,319
in braces.

69
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,310
This argument means that the
document, after compilation,

70
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,459
will be issued in the form of an article.

71
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,989
In addition to “article”, there are
other standard categories, such as

72
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,609
“book” for writing a book or
“report” for writing

73
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,609
a report.

74
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:30,480
It is important to note that
the category can be non-standard.

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,840
For instance, to prepare
a publication for a journal or

76
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,459
a conference proceeding,
a special category 

77
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,940
can be used that takes into
account the requirements

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
of the editorial design.

79
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,340
To do this, you will need to place
the file with the cls extension 

80
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,279
downloaded from the editorial site
in the folder with the tex file.

81
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:51,370
Regarding the \documentclass
command, optional settings

82
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,930
can be specified in
the square brackets, 

83
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,219
separated by commas, between
a command name and the

84
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,859
mandatory argument.

85
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:01,129
For example, point size,
paper format,

86
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,959
dual column text, etc.

87
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,379
The command \documentclass is
followed by connecting the packages,

88
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,559
depending on the
functionality required.

89
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,800
These packages can either be
pre-installed with the

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,290
TeX distribution or can
be downloaded from

91
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,900
the repository during compiled time.

92
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,530
The next important concept,
which is actively used while

93
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,550
working with LaTeX, is called
environment. It is

94
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,690
set using the following
construction.

95
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,789
Notice that there is
a mandatory argument

96
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,629
in the braces –
the name of the environment.

97
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,350
Depending on the
selected environment,

98
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,410
some additional arguments,
both mandatory

99
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,940
and optional can be specified.

100
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,920
Regarding the structure of
the source file, after

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,660
declaring the document style and
entire preamble, it is necessary

102
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,319
to define an environment that represents
the body of the document itself.

103
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,520
Inside we will have the
content of the document.

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,349
When typing, keep in
mind basic rules.

105
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:57,970
Words in the source file are
separated from each other

106
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,589
by spaces, while the number
of spaces does not matter –

107
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,940
when compiling, only one
will be placed between

108
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,099
the words.

109
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,900
Carrying over to the new
line is also perceived as

110
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,330
a space.

111
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,479
Paragraphs are separated
by blank lines.

112
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,250
After the compilation
most of the characters appear

113
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,320
as they appear in the source file.

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,580
An exception is the special
characters used in

115
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,220
the LaTeX syntax including:
backslash, braces, percentage,

116
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,379
underlining, circumflex,
tilde, dollar sign, hash.

117
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,860
To format the text
specific commands are

118
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,650
used, after changing
the current font settings

119
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,419
(e.g. point size,
style, etc.).

120
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,800
These changes are distributed
to the end of the current group,

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,900
which is limited to either
the current environment

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,550
or braces.

123
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,870
The convenience of the LaTeX system
is that many routine tasks are 

124
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,759
automated like adding links.

125
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,070
When it is necessary
to refer to a specific

126
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,180
place in

127
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,569
the text,
for example, 

128
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,849
to a sentence
or a

129
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,290
word on
another page,

130
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,610
you can use the
following commands:

131
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,949
\pageref{} command, which
returns to the page number,

132
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,100
or the \ref{} command, which
returns to the number of the

133
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
corresponding section.

134
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,210
The system also automizes
updates of page and chapter

135
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,280
numbers during compilation.

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,069
In the same way, organizes
the references in numbered

137
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,300
formulas, figures,
tables, etc.

138
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,349
At the end of this lecture,
try to create

139
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,430
your first document using
the example given.

140
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,240
Please note that by default,
the LaTeX system does

141
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
not support the Russian language.

142
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,879
Therefore, it is necessary
to include in the preamble

143
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,569
the corresponding
packages, namely

144
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,880
the encoding in which the Russian
text will be added.

145
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,659
In the next video, we will consider
a set of formulas, adding

146
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,360
pictures and tables
in the LaTeX system.
