00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,250
 Hello.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,880
 This lecture will be devoted to scientometric indicators of journals.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,720
 First attempts to make use  of scientometrics, use 

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,400
 citations in work of scientific and research organizations

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,990
 were made in 1927, while gathering librarian collections

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,830
 of some universities.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,380
 This whole system is based on the assumption that if some

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,730
 articles are cited more often than others, they have

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,470
 better quality. And if these

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,860
 frequently cited articles get into a journal, this means that

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,530
 the quality of this journal is much higher than

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,399
 that of other journal in this subject area.

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,620
 First and the most well-knownindicator 

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,310
 that is used for journals’ evaluation 

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,420
 is Impact factor.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,261
 I want to emphasize that real Impact factor may be

17
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,629
 calculated only for the journals included in Web of Science system.

18
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:56,629
 Why?

19
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,350
 Because Web of Science has rights on the word 

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,800
 brand “Impact factor”, that’s why.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,860
 How is Impact factor calculated? Impact factor is a number of

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,440
 citations made in a particular year 

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,920
 of the articles published in this journal

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,860
 during previous two years, divided by total number of articles 

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,390
 over the same period of time. Impact factor cannot be used 

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,200
 to compare journals from different scientific areas

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,039
 because of the following reasons:

28
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,680
 - Different publication activity in different areas

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,580
 - Different number of researchers

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,670
 - And simply because of difference in frequency of documents publishing

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,270
 In addition to the classical Impact factor, that includes 

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,810
 information about a two-year period,

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,150
 there is so called five-year impact factor.

34
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,360
 These two indicators are in constant rivalry, trying 

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,729
 to prove which one is more accurate.

36
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,380
 In fact, the two-year Impact factor allows making operations 

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,380
 more frequently, which is logical, while the five-year one 

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,320
 includes more samples, and shows 

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,689
 more qualitative evaluation of a journal.

40
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,260
 In Scopus system there is CiteScore, which is

41
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,229
 Impact factor’s analog. It is calculated in exactly 

42
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,229
 the same way – it is a correlation between the citations 

43
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,580
 in a particular year and the number of articles

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,259
 in this journal over the previous three years.

45
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,400
 The only difference is the number of years

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,129
 that is taken for the analysis – 

47
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,860
 two years for Impact factor,

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,980
 and three years for CiteScore.

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,420
 It is important to note that both Impact factor and CiteScore

50
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,360
 are calculated for the previous year or the year before last.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,709
 This is done to avoid risk of missing citations

52
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,910
 that were made during current year,

53
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,680
 but have not been indexed just yet, or have not been made

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,260
 during current calendar year.

55
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,840
 Another important indicatoris SNIP, Source normalized impact per paper.

56
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,340
 What does it allow to do? It helps in situations?

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,860
 when neither classical Impact factor nor CiteScore work,

58
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,230
 in particular it allows to compare journals from different

59
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,980
 subject areas.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,640
 How is it possible?

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,230
 It is possible because SNIP considers size of

62
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,260
 the subject area, number of researchers

63
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,030
 working in this area, as well as potential citations,

64
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,060
 meaning the assumption on how many citations an article

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,730
 devoted to one or another issue can potentially get.

66
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,920
 Another important metrics is Eigenfactor or so called

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 prestige factor.

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,819
 It has the iterative model in its basis, similar to that

69
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,260
 used by Google Pagerank, created by Larry Page.

70
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,840
 As soon as you type in your retrieval request in Google,

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,750
 the links get arranged in certain order:

72
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,170
 first ones are considered to be the most reliable,

73
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,700
 popular or prestigious. If we imagine it as

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,670
 a comprehensible model,

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,239
 it would work the following way: if your article was cited

76
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,860
 in Nature and in some random journal of

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,960
 a regional university,  he former citation would

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,110
 weight way more.

79
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,410
 It might weight hundred or even thousand times more.

80
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,629
 SJR is calculated on the basis of Scopus databases,

81
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:12,250
 and has its own portal that shows ranking of all journals

82
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,060
 included in Scopus, as well

83
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,189
 as rakings of countries, universities

84
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,530
 and even separate research groups.

85
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,381
 Not only SJR is published on a  separate portal where you can

86
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:27,090
 find rankings of journals, countries and universities,

87
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,310
 evaluated on the basis of

88
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,180
 this indicator, it is also used for determination of 

89
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,009
 journals’ quartile. There are four journal quartile

90
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,650
 s in Scopus and Web of Science The most well-known and popular

91
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,919
 articles are published in the first quartile, 

92
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,520
 while the least popular ones - in the fourth quartile respectively.

93
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,460
 In Scopus system we would use CiteScore for this ranking,

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,950
 while in Web of Science

95
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,150
 we would use Impact factor for this.

96
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,680
 In addition to classical indicators,

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,990
 there are several alternative ones, so called “alt metrics”.

98
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,009
 In fact, they are references to a scientific work,

99
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,650
 published in a scientific journal, but references made

100
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,759
 in popular public and political media, or in social networks, 

101
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,360
 such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and what not.

102
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,601
 In this context, there is such an interesting thing 

103
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:31,350
 as NY Times scientific citation index.

104
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,070
 When in Sunday scientific column of NY Times

105
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,259
 the review on a scientific research is published,

106
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,610
 its scientometric indicators  ise considerably, which confirms 

107
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,320
 that public interest to one or another scientific issue,

108
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
 one or another scientific article,

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,949
 may have serious influence  on academia and career of 

110
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,802
 an individual scientist. Nonetheless, in spite of

111
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,860
 the fact that scientometric indicators are relatively

112
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,460
 established procedure for evaluation of scientific work,

113
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,410
 potential of a research, as well as career of individual 

114
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,860
 scientists, one should use them with great caution, and

115
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,039
 remember that citation indicators, H-indices, and impact factors

116
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,960
 do not always give an accurate evaluation of

117
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,020
 a work’s quality.
