00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone, my name is
Daniil, and we are about to start a new module

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,630
devoted to scientometric
indicators.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,400
Scientometrics is a comprehensive research
field that studies

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,690
and assesses not only journals
and individual scientists,

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,650
but also research
organizations and

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,690
the science itself based on
 quantitative methods.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,289
There are dozens and hundreds of different

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,749
scientometric indicators.

9
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,820
We will discuss only
 the basic ones.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,249
Particularly those that are
 related to individual

11
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:29,249
scientists.

12
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:31,669
Here there are three main metrics.

13
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,550
First one is total number of tests and total

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,750
number of publications of a particular
 researcher.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,050
It is usually assumed that the more citations
 you have, the more

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,050
demanded you are.

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,770
The more publications you have, the more
 productive

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,780
scientist you are.

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,040
However, this metric has
one key drawback.

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,050
First of all, as
 the time goes it may only increase,

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,270
which is logical, because as you develop your   scientific career,

22
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,550
you write more and more articles, and get more

23
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,560
citations; having said that, it is not
 quite correct to compare

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,439
young scientists with
 the distinguished ones,

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,909
because the latter
 would have much higher

26
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,399
metrics.

27
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,789
Second indicator is evaluation of citations
 number

28
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:13,539
of the author's most cited publication.

29
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,600
Why is this needed?

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,810
For instance, your scientific career was very short

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,789
or during your academic path you have
 just published

32
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,100
a couple of monographs and
 articles, which

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,409
nonetheless have dramatically
 changed

34
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,549
your research field.

35
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,569
Most likely, it will
 gain big number of citations,

36
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,020
but if to use other
 scientometric

37
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,079
indicators, it will not be seen.

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,530
Therefore, we are talking about him
always separate.

39
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,329
This is why we always take this

40
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,549
one into consideration.

41
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,079
Hirsch index is a metrics
 that was suggested

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,889
in 2005 by an Argentine American
 physicist Jorge Hirsch from

43
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,029
University of California
in San Diego.

44
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:59,240
This is an attempt to balance
 qualitative

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,119
and quantitative evaluation of
 scientist's works.

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,579
But in reality

47
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,579
it fails in both.

48
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,880
H-index is calculated the following way: your
 h-index amounts to n

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,890
if you have n number of
 publications, each of which

50
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,810
was cited at least n
 times.

51
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,700
For example,

52
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,080
if your h-index is 5, it
 means that you have

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,080
written 5 articles, each of
 which was cited at least 5

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
times.

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Congratulations.

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,930
As a rule, when we talk about h-index,

57
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,680
we have to mention several
 key drawbacks of this

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
metrics.

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,970
First of all, it does not consider input of each
 particular

60
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,060
scientist in joint work.

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,610
Let's say that there is a big research

62
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,340
group that
 works at the Large Hadron Collider

63
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,630
and writes an article, and there is you.

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,540
And you have been writing
 your monography for several years.

65
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,130
In both cases, citations

66
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,730
for one member of the
 group and for you,

67
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,130
as an individual author, will
 always amount to an arbitrary unit.

68
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,660
This is not always correct.

69
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,340
Secondly, h-index ignores those scientific
 fields

70
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,200
that are not presented in the form of
 classical reports

71
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,040
or conferences, publications or
 reviews.

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,010
For instance, if we consider modern
 technologies,

73
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,590
patents are usually the way to
 report and demonstrate

74
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,490
scientific activity in the
 field.

75
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,470
Or perhaps, there are some books and
 monographies that are not very well indexed

76
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,990
in scientometric data bases.

77
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,430
Thirdly, and we have mentioned this before, h-
 index

78
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,310
ignores your most cited and important
 articles.

79
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,650
For example, if you have

80
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,730
written only
 three works, and one of them is

81
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,100
cited dozens or thousands of times, your

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,970
h-index

83
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,220
will still be 3.

84
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,000
On the other hand, you could
have written fifteen

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
articles of fair quality, and each of

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,940
them would be cited at least fifteen times.

87
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,760
In this case you h-index would amount to 15.

88
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,920
But in reality you have not influenced  significantly

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,850
to your research field.

90
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,140
Moreover, besides h-index per se,

91
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,800
there are several h-index-like indicators.

92
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,590
Scientometricists have a joke that another h-
 index-like

93
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,510
indicator is invented every second
 week, and they do not monitor

94
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,150
them anymore.

95
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,220
Nonetheless, m- and g-indices have fitted in
 more or less.

96
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,000
M-index is same h-index

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,030
that additionally
 considers length of

98
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,840
scientific career or, to put it
 differently, that very

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,620
time period over which the scientific works in   consideration

100
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
were written.

101
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,720
Thus, it enables to balance young and
 experienced scientists.

102
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,840
and already experienced at the academy
person.

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,590
G-index compensates for another significant

104
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,180
drawback of h-index, and considers input of
 your

105
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,980
most cited

106
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,980
articles.

107
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,070
It uses concept of
 average citation index.

108
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,330
Furthermore, there are so called specialized

109
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,340
h-indices.

110
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,170
Biologists have their own h-index,
 biological

111
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,170
index;

112
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,569
physicists have their own as
 well; and so on.

113
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,569
Why is it needed?

114
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,380
It is an attempt to balance
 difference in citations

115
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,139
across scientific fields.

116
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,690
The point is that, on the one hand, there is
molecular

117
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,350
biology, as actively developing
 field, with

118
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,840
many articles being published

119
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
and cited.

120
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,370
Thus, h-indices of researches in this field
 will increase actively

121
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,370
and promptly.

122
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,851
On the other hand, there is mathematics

123
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,360
and mathematicians publish their articles much  rarer,

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
preferring monographs to publications.

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,570
They also cite each other seldom.

126
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,050
This is why, on average, their h-indices will be  lower than

127
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,260
those of biologists, yet their input

128
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,360
in science per se might not

129
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,110
differ.

130
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,169
For this reason, the field-specialized  indicators

131
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,169
are used.

132
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,160
Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that,
 despite all

133
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,860
its shortcomings, h-index is the
 most well-known

134
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,110
indicator that is widely used
 in the whole

135
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,720
scientific community.

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,449
Generally, it is a good attempt to balance
 quality

137
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,560
and quantity, but we should

138
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,180
understand what actually
 stands behind these numbers.

139
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,480
For all the shortcomings of the Hirsch index,
 this is one of the most

140
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,940
common indicators that have taken root in the   scientific community.

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,960
It is widely used by scientists, and you can often

142
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,250
see it in the beginning or in the end of
 presentation of a particular

143
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
scientist.

144
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,050
It is a rather good attempt to balance quality

145
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,820
and quantity, but we should understand what

146
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,240
actually stands behind these numbers.

147
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,050
At the following lecture we will talk about those scientometric

148
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,840
indicators, which are used
for particular articles

149
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,620
and journals, and which are used for evaluation of

150
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,220
universities activity.
