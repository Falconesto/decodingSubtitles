Hello, dear students.

0:00:01.750,0:00:04.529

0:00:04.529,0:00:07.820
instructor for this
module titled

0:00:07.820,0:00:09.220
Personal Effectiveness.

0:00:09.220,0:00:11.240
Have you ever thought
about what personal

0:00:11.240,0:00:12.240
effectiveness means to you?

0:00:12.240,0:00:13.919
How to manage your time?

How to find a balance between
the different areas of your life? 

0:00:16.800,0:00:19.670
While being a student,
it seems that time

0:00:19.670,0:00:21.840
and energy are unlimited.

0:00:21.840,0:00:25.300
Nonetheless, with every passing
year the world around you will

make even greater demands on you.

of a company or run your own business.

a family and become

0:00:33.260,0:00:34.260
a parent.

0:00:34.260,0:00:37.050
The number of responsibilities will
continue to grow rapidly and 

0:00:37.050,0:00:40.660
“go with the flow” will not
be the most effective strategy. 

0:00:40.660,0:00:43.890

of your relationships
with others.

0:01:17.140,0:01:20.600
The lectures will continue to discuss
