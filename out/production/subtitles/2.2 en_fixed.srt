1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,809
So, we continue
discussing publications.

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,310
A scientific article is
a text that describes your

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,860
research and discusses
your results.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,530
Thus, let us suppose that you’ve
conducted a research and want

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,019
to share your results and
findings with the rest of the world.

6
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,619
What would you begin
writing article with?

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,130
First of all it is important for
you to understand that working

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,640
on article is
a long process.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,940
It is impossible to write
a good research article

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,400
in a night, a day or
in a few hours before

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,210
submitting it
for a publication.

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,190
That is why the first thing
to think of is formulating

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,100
a working title
of your article.

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,250
You’ll understand the
final title of the article

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,290
when you complete
working on your text.

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,120
The working title, in
its turn, will help you

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
follow the planned direction.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,310
It would also be beneficial
to formulate the list of

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,650
key words at this stage.

20
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,190
The next aspect to consider
is the journal where you will

21
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,470
submit your article
and the potential

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,470
readership.

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,760
Please be conscious
while choosing a journal,

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,750
this choice cannot be random.

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,430
Before submitting
your manuscript to one or 

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,610
another journal you
need to read articles

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,760
published there previously.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,840
This would help you imagine
your potential

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,070
reader, and the course of your
narrative, your research’s description,

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,619
the choice and interpretation
of terms would depend on it.

31
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,780
Every journal
also has

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,580
its requirement to
articles’ format,

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,230
number of characters
and bibliography.

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,270
After you’ve formulated
your article’s working title,

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,470
chosen a journal and
imagined your potential reader,

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,060
you are able to start
working on your text.

37
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,560
You need to have a detailed
plan, structural parts of

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,560
which represent different
parts of your article.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,500
This means that your plan would
include introduction, methods,

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,720
results, and discussion/conclusion,
abstract, bibliography

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,790
and appendices.

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,069
You need to work on all the
parts of your plan simultaneously.

43
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,230
This is a sort
of brainstorming.

44
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,130
And you need to write down everything
that comes to your mind, everything

45
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,370
you want to tell about.

46
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,480
At this stage you shouldn’t
concentrate on your text’s

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,010
form – you should
think of the content.

48
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,010
After you fill in all the
parts of your detailed plan,

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,220
please leave it
aside and come back to

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,069
it in a
day or two.

51
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,310
When you are back the real
editing of your text will

52
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,310
start.

53
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,560
You will be reading and
re-reading your article, adding

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,670
and removing something.

55
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,540
This cycle should repeat
itself for a number of

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,950
times until there
is nothing else to

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,010
remove from your text.

58
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,670
A paragraph is a structural
unit of a scientific

59
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,960
and any other text.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,460
A paragraph starts with an
introduction followed by the main phrase,

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,440
supporting facts and conclusion.

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,879
Paragraphs are connected by
prepositions, conjunctions,

63
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,360
introductory words and speech clichés.

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,530
You need to edit your
language and register

65
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,790
after the text of
your article is ready.

66
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,049
Please get rid
of filler words –

67
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,340
these are the words
that have no sense or

68
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,400
structural
function.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,000
It is also necessary
to get rid of repetitive

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,750
lexical units and lexical
constructions, if any.

71
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,130
Also, it is not common
to use a pronoun

72
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,380
“I” in Russian
academic writing.

73
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,940
You’ll have to use “we”
or “authors” instead,

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,660
even if you
made research

75
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,120
on your own.

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,190
I will tell you more
about register and grammar

77
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,100
when writing in English
in the next lecture.
