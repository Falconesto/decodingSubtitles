1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,990
We continue talking about
publications, and today

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,510
we will discuss how
to write a research

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,730
article in English.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,710
An article in English is similar
to an engineering device,

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,630
which has a rigid structure
and each part of it

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,159
has its own function.

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,189
It is important to note that the structural
element of an article in English,

8
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,499
just like in Russian,
is a paragraph.

9
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:37,710
It works in the same
manner as in Russian –

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,850
one idea is
one paragraph.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,280
One paragraph contains an
introduction that is followed by

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,640
informational sentences, which
confirm the introduction and

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
present examples, and a
closing phrase.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
Sentences in English
language should not be 

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
longer than 10-12 words,
they should not be long.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,630
If you are not an English
native speaker, this

17
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,190
will help you, first of all,
not to lose your idea, be

18
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,550
clear with what you want to say.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,070
On the other hand, it will
let you think of the reader

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,160
that you are writing for.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,720
Clearly, nowadays English
is a global language for the

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,060
whole international community of
scientists and researchers,

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,970
this is why your publication may
be read by a Chinese, Spaniard,

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,120
Frenchman, or Italian, and you
should make sure that they can

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,820
understand your research
and scientific results.

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,600
This is why your thought
should be expressed accurately

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,810
and clearly in 10-12 words.

28
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,920
Now, we should discuss lexical
and grammatical linguistic

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,140
means that will help
you in writing

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,710
articles in English.

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,730
First of all,
it is the voice.

32
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,560
Today there is a tendency in
English for academic purposes

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,720
that suggests us to choose
active voice instead

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,560
of passive one.

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,190
In fact,
this enables

36
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,420
you to take responsibility
for your research and

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,750
for the report
that you

38
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,620
present in
your publication.

39
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,140
To put it differently,
active voice helps you to

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,520
claim that you are the author
of this particular research.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,010
It does not mean that you
cannot or should not use

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,890
passive voice
at all.

43
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,340
Passive voice is very
useful in such chapters

44
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,190
as methods and results,
where you present how

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,670
your experiment proceeded,
and the findings

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,450
that you obtained.

47
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,790
Concerning
tenses: 

48
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,080
their use in Academic
English is limited.

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,420
As a rule, you use
only five tenses:

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,410
present simple, past simple, present continuous,
past continuous and present perfect.

51
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,150
Future simple is sometimes
used as well, especially

52
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,540
in Conclusion chapter.

53
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:49,340
However, the meaning that
future simple gives to a

54
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,510
statement is quite
fuzzy and inexact.

55
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,430
This is why, other
lexical and grammatical

56
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,770
constructs should be preferred to
future simple when describing

57
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,770
your plans for the future.

58
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,020
As far as present perfect is
concerned, you can use

59
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,849
this tense when you state
what you have done, which

60
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,930
methods you have used, what
results you have gained,

61
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,420
as well as in conclusion
when you should present

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,160
your findings.

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,439
While working on an article
text, reading it over 

64
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,449
and over again, you should get
rid of all lexical items

65
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,699
that are frequently repeated.

66
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,949
You can highlight
all repeating

67
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,259
words with a highlighter.

68
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,610
This way, firstly, you will
understand how many

69
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,909
repetitions you have.

70
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:50,990
Secondly, you will find
parts the text that need to

71
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,979
be rephrased and extra words
that should be deleted.

72
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:01,360
I want to mention
specifically frequent use of

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,099
“of” preposition by
Russian native speakers.

74
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:10,069
Its active use is conditioned
by our mother tongue, but in

75
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:17,389
order to make the text sound
good in English, you should

76
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,650
use “of”
rarely.

77
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,219
You can use a color highlighter
again in order to find all

78
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:30,830
the phrases with “of”
and check where you can

79
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,089
change it with a
chains of nouns.

80
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:38,550
A chain of nouns is
a phrase that contains

81
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,110
two-three-four nouns
without prepositions.

82
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,099
It is often used
in academic English,

83
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,240
and is a good substitution
for preposition “of”.

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,379
ТI also want to note that
the more you read

85
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:54,009
the better you write.

86
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:59,249
When you read articles in
your scientific field, you learn

87
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:03,659
specific terms,
to begin with.

88
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:09,039
Secondly, you see language
patterns and phrases that

89
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,029
other authors use in their
publications, and you can add

90
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,559
them to your works.

91
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,909
How to do it?

92
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,919
You should take two or
three different highlighters;

93
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:28,150
Underline, for example, with
pink all lexical items

94
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,629
and phrases that are you
are familiar with, but you

95
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,999
forget to use them in
your texts for some

96
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:35,999
reason.

97
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:41,280
Use yellow highlighter for the
new words and phrases

98
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,789
that you would start
use in your works.

99
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:51,469
And you can underline
with blue all 

100
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:52,960
useful terms.

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,559
I think this can be very
useful for your work on

102
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,660
the text and content
of your article.

103
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,490
These are just common rules
and recommendations for

104
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,939
writing articles in
English.

105
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,249
However, the rules
exist to be broken.

106
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,759
For example, subjunctive mood
is not recommended to be

107
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,289
used in scientific articles,
but if you want to write

108
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,680
about some results that
you could potentially obtain,

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,930
but have not, you
can use subjunctive

110
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,930
mood.

111
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,630
The important part here is that
you and your reader should

112
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,819
understand why you do it.

113
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,319
You may find other recommendations
on writing articles in English

114
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,499
in supplementary
materials for

115
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:46,519
the course.
