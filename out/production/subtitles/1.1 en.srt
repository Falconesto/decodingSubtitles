Welcome to the “Living in Science” Online Course.

0:00:03.530,0:00:06.590
I am Dmitry Malkov, director of Science Communication Centre

0:00:06.590,0:00:08.000
and lecturer at ITMO University.

0:00:08.000,0:00:10.990
In the following two videos, I will discuss

0:00:10.990,0:00:13.660
the focus of our course and how it is organized.

0:00:13.660,0:00:16.449
I will inform you on the key modules,

0:00:16.449,0:00:18.900
lecturers and requirements. Most importantly,

0:00:18.900,0:00:22.449
you will be able to answer the question: 
Which forms of life exist in science?

0:00:22.449,0:00:25.210
Every student ponders about
his or her place in science.

0:00:25.210,0:00:27.019
During the study period at University,
students undertake

0:00:27.019,0:00:29.329
the role of a researcher to discover

0:00:29.329,0:00:31.509
his or her own scientific interests.

0:00:31.509,0:00:33.230
Each of these interests require

0:00:33.230,0:00:35.860
countless hours in the laboratory,

0:00:35.860,0:00:38.980
making it difficult to research each one.

0:00:38.980,0:00:40.940
We can conclude that the field
of science is connected with   

0:00:40.940,0:00:43.850
countless experiments, hardware setups,

0:00:43.850,0:00:45.590
and complex calculations.

0:00:45.590,0:00:47.890
However, the field is not limited

0:00:47.890,0:00:49.040
to this.

0:00:49.040,0:00:51.190
Science can be seen as
 a social institution.

0:00:51.190,0:00:53.660
The role science and technology 
has taken in the fields

0:00:53.660,0:00:56.760
of economic and social development
has always been a subject matter

0:00:56.760,0:00:57.760
for scholars and thinkers.

0:00:57.760,0:00:59.810
Vannevar Bush, an American scientist
and public figure,

0:00:59.810,0:01:02.810
had a prominent impact on the
modern perspective of science  

0:01:02.810,0:01:04.850
in the 20th century.

0:01:04.850,0:01:07.920
He was able to convince Presidents
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman

0:01:07.920,0:01:11.060
 of the need to control technology during war

0:01:11.060,0:01:12.530
and facilitate peace post-war.

0:01:12.530,0:01:16.280
Bush always said that science is
a “goose that lays golden eggs”.

0:01:16.280,0:01:19.219
That is to say science and technology
gave rise to economic

0:01:19.219,0:01:21.409
and social prosperity.

0:01:21.409,0:01:24.139
His point of view was later confirmed through

0:01:24.139,0:01:26.850
the works of many economists,

0:01:26.850,0:01:28.539
including Nobel laureate Robert Solow.

0:01:28.539,0:01:31.180
Not surprisingly, fundamental and applied research

0:01:31.180,0:01:33.950
is now embedded in our reality, from the methods
of communication and transportation

0:01:33.950,0:01:36.929
to the interactions within ecology
and the health care system. 

0:01:36.929,0:01:39.969
The idea of prosperity has surpassed
a goose laying golden eggs

0:01:39.969,0:01:41.850
to geese laying golden eggs.

0:01:41.850,0:01:44.619
This state of affairs requires
modern scientists

0:01:44.619,0:01:47.750
to be more proactive and have the
capability to convey their ideas to

0:01:47.750,0:01:51.299
a variety of audiences: the state,
the funding organizations 

0:01:51.299,0:01:52.840
and the industry representatives.

0:01:52.840,0:01:55.360
The illusion of a scientist working alone 

0:01:55.360,0:01:58.639
in the dark has no validity 

0:01:58.639,0:01:59.639
in modern science.

0:01:59.639,0:02:02.149
Today the boundaries of scientific
disciplines are being redefined 

0:02:02.149,0:02:03.840
before one’s eyes.

0:02:03.840,0:02:06.320
Interdisciplinarity
and transdisiciplinarity approaches

0:02:06.320,0:02:10.050
have allowed scientists to continuously

0:02:10.050,0:02:13.160
go beyond their scientific fields to collaborate

0:02:13.160,0:02:14.910
in search of solutions.

0:02:14.910,0:02:18.500
To be successful in science today,
your expertise

0:02:18.500,0:02:21.440
and research skills need
to be complemented by

0:02:21.440,0:02:22.970
a range of soft skills.

0:02:22.970,0:02:25.670
Not only should you be up to date

0:02:25.670,0:02:28.410
in your research field, but also understand

0:02:28.410,0:02:30.980
the national priorities for scientific
and technical development.

0:02:30.980,0:02:34.670
You will need to be exposed to global challenges,

0:02:34.670,0:02:38.460
build a research strategy and

0:02:38.460,0:02:41.580
a commercialization model
for your developments.

0:02:41.580,0:02:42.580
You will then be able to communicate
your ideas to grantors,

0:02:42.580,0:02:44.990
business representatives and government officials.

0:02:44.990,0:02:47.811
We hope that this course will
help you to find

0:02:47.811,0:02:47.830
your way in science!
