Hello!

0:00:01.890,0:00:04.870
My name is Ilya Kuftyrev and
I am pleased to present the next

0:00:04.870,0:00:07.200
module titled Scientometrics
and Bibliography. 

0:00:07.200,0:00:11.781
In the previous section,
Publications, the lecture explored   

0:00:11.781,0:00:14.430
what is a publication, how to
prepare and work with one.

0:00:14.430,0:00:17.539
Now moving along to the
next section, we will explore

0:00:17.539,0:00:21.730
interesting topics such as
bibliographic databases,

0:00:21.730,0:00:24.579
including Scopus and 
Web of Science.

0:00:24.579,0:00:29.210
We will discuss in detail what
are Scientometric indicators

0:00:29.210,0:00:32.761
and how these specific
indicators study the

0:00:32.761,0:00:35.640
productivity and effectiveness
of the scientific activity.

0:00:35.640,0:00:40.050
I am certain that you will be able
to use these indicators in

0:00:40.050,0:00:44.590
evaluating the effectiveness
of your own scientific activities. 

0:00:44.590,0:00:50.100
The last topic that will be
covered in this section

0:00:50.100,0:00:51.160
is university rankings.

0:00:51.160,0:00:54.020
Are there any common factors
between university rankings,

0:00:54.020,0:00:56.149
your own effectiveness
and Soft Skills?

0:00:56.149,0:01:00.399
We will try to connect
these three components. 

0:01:00.399,0:01:04.530
I would like to point out that
not all of these topics are 

0:01:04.530,0:01:08.440
studied in academic disciplines
at University.

0:01:08.440,0:01:11.170
It is why I am certain this
module will be twice as

0:01:11.170,0:01:13.960
beneficial to you.

0:01:13.960,0:01:17.110
Firstly, these are interesting
topics that lead to interesting knowledge.

0:01:17.110,0:01:19.390
Secondly, I am certain that
you will be able to

0:01:19.390,0:01:21.670
apply this knowledge
in the future!
