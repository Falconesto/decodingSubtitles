00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Dear students, we have already learned
different time and energy management
techniques.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,900
Today I want to talk to you
about attention management.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:17,800
Harvard university psychologists have
conducted some research, the results of
which show, that we spend 47% of awake
time dreaming.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,300
Thus, instead of focusing on
important tasks our brain is dispersed and
unfocused.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,800
Let’s inspect the mistakes we make while
working

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,200
and learn how to carefully manage
our attention.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,700
Mistake №1 – trying to keep everything in
your head.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,600
Every bit of information not written or
otherwise stored on an external device takes
up room in our short-term memory and
steals our attention.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Our brain is an
extremely powerful tool and it can process a
lot of information, but it cannot store the
vast amounts of information we pour into
our brains.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,700
Usually we do not write down
simple tasks such as “Buy some bread” or
“Call travel agency” but instead try to
remember them all.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,800
This leads to tense
moments when you are trying to figure out
what exactly you have forgotten

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,200
or trying to
recall it right now, distracting yourself from
current work.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,500
Solution:

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,700
1. Write down your tasks and goals. This will
allow you to free up your memory and make
you more organized.

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,300
2. Put all your meetings on your calendar as this will allow you to receive notifications about upcoming events.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,500
3. Make shopping lists before going shopping.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,500
4. Write down all your ideas, as they tend to disappear into subconsciousness .

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,600
and when they reappear, they may seem new to you

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,300
Mistake № 2 - imprecise wording of your tasks.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:44,300
Whenever you open your organizer and see a note “Mary”, you are most likely going to think what exactly

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:52,300
you have meant by this note and which Mary it refers to. Making your notes too short makes your brain to work harder.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,600
On the other hand, a very  long note leads to procrastination.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Word your notes properly.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,900
1. The task you are writing down should be simple and contain one specific step.

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,300
2. Use brief and clear wording.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,400
3. Be sure to state the action you must complete.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Mistake №3 – accumulation of unfinished tasks

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,600
We constantly keep thinking about things we have not done, such as unread letters, unfulfilled promises, phone calls not made

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 – we keep thinking about these tasks and this creates tension, brings us anxiety and steals our attention.

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,500
We often tend to feel guilty for our procrastination and that adversely affects our self-control.

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
Solution:

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,100
1. Solve simple tasks as soon as possible.

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,200
2. Set  deadlines for all of your tasks

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,800
3. Create checklists of all unfulfilled tasks and work on them

35
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:50,825
4. If you decide that you do not want to do a certain task – cross it out

36
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:56,300
of your list so that you feel better about it and are able to move on.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,900
5. Organize and clean up your workplace, computer and e-mail.

38
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,800
Now let us talk about mistakes that are more serious.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Mistake № 4 – Multitasking

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
Though it is true that most of us can manage several different tasks at the same time,

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,800
our brain can only focus on one particular task.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Multitasking makes us less productive, we make more mistakes and it often causes more stress throughout the workday.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,400
You also spend more total time on your work as any

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,500
distraction causes you to spend 10-15 extra minutes to regain your concentration.

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,600
Nevertheless, we love multitasking as it offers an illusion of productivity.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,300
Solution:

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,200
1. Remind yourself that multitasking only hurts your performance, especially when it comes to mental work.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,100
2. Concentrate all your attention on one task during a fixed time period

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,300
3. Make other people aware of your being busy

50
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,300
4. Minimize the amount of possible distractions; turn off all unimportant notifications on your phone and computer.

51
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,800
5. Try not to accumulate too many important urgent tasks that will distract you from your current work.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Mistake № 5 – Overwhelming your brain with information.

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Nowadays we often face enormous amounts of all kinds of information

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,300
and often it is not important for us.

55
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Excess information decreases your ability to concentrate as well as your cognitive abilities.

56
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,900
Solution:

57
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,100
1. Learn to filter the information you receive and critically observe whether you really need it.

58
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,900
2. Use different kinds of adblocks in your browsers.

59
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,400
3. Clean up your email subscriptions, leave all the unnecessary groups and chats in messengers.

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,300
4. Set up a time limit for your internet sessions and control yourself.

61
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,800
Mistake № 6 – Work overload

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Working long hours without any breaks, mental work during periods of biological decline, working in night – all these

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,700
factors tend to decrease your performance and decrease your work speed as well as increase chances of burnout.

64
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,100
Solution:

65
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,800
1. Remind yourself that your brain needs some rest. Quality rest can only be

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,300
achieved via long sleep or moderate physical activity and change of activity.

67
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,500
Work in short cycles of 20-25 minutes. In this lecture’s appendix

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,100
 I have shared my favorite technique – The Pomodoro method.

69
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,600
3. Take quality breaks.

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,900
4. Keep your sleep schedule.

71
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,400
Finally, Mistake № 7 – Internal distractions

72
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,500
An important part of your attention resource is being here and now.

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,700
We, however, often tend to think about past, present and future tasks and problems at the same time.

74
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,000
Solution:

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,200
1. Keep asking yourself what is important at the moment. Keeping track of

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
your current priorities helps you to concentrate on your goals.

77
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:17,500
Work on your emotional state. Negative thoughts and feelings can easily capture you entirely

78
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,700
and distract you from your work, as we always tend to think about things that worry us the most.

79
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,000
Analyze your emotions carefully and control your mood.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,400
3. Do not forget to praise and reward yourself for your accomplishments. We all need some sort of stimulation to keep us motivated.

81
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,300
Probably you think that it requires a lot of effort to manage your time, energy and attention effectively.

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,500
However, it is only true in the beginning, as quite soon new methods

83
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,200
and ways of managing your time will turn into habits and it will make your life a lot easier.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,800
The best reward for your efforts will be your outstanding results.

85
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,213
Good luck!
