1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Good afternoon dear students.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,280
Today we start a series of lectures, devoted to business and scientific ethics.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,380
First mini-lecture will be devoted to business communication ethics.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,500
We will discuss what business communication is,

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,940
what types of business communication exist,

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,240
and what rules need to be followed while having business correspondence,

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,080
phone discussion and communication in social networks.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,540
So, what is business communication?

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
In a nutshell, business communication

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,080
is interaction in professional environment

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,860
for dealing with work matters or tasks.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,600
To make business communication effective

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,220
and generally reasonable,

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,500
one should follow several rules:

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,720
First of all, any communication should have its goal,

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,320
and all participants should be interested in it.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,840
For example, it could be negotiations,

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,540
signing an agreement,

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,880
establishing relations, or an event organization.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,960
Second condition of business communication is observing business etiquette,

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,960
subordination, professional roles,

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,620
and formal boundaries.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,280
Under formal boundaries I imply

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,280
compliance with various protocols, regulations,

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,200
as well as simple necessity to control your emotions

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
and respect your partners and colleagues.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,860
So, efficient communication.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,180
This is how it works:

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,160
Firstly, 

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,260
we need to choose 

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,600
right means or channel of communication.

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,880
Secondly,

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,800
you should stick to particular format,

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,400
fitting into this channel of communication.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,540
Thirdly,

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,200
you should also abide by universal rules,

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
such as respect, literacy, benevolence,

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,680
kind attitude towards your colleagues and partners.

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,640
Believe me, compliance with formal and informal rules of business communication

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,520
makes interaction with people much easier

41
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,980
and creates comfortable environment at work with your colleagues.

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,860
Life hack:

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,620
if you initiate business communication,

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,080
it is your task to choose channel of communication,

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
for example, business correspondence,

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,320
and suggest it to your partner or colleague.

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,300
In the opposite situation, when your colleague has sent you a request,

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,480
for example, in form of email,

49
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,980
you should support this choice of communication channel,

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,380
and reply in the same style and form.

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,160
There are several kinds of communication channels.

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,060
In fact, all of them may be divided into four groups.

53
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,980
First one is related to communication

54
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,600
that requires personal presence of all parties.

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,260
For example, it can be personal face-to-face discussion, such as an interview.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,280
It can be a group meeting, such as a staff meeting or negotiations.

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,880
It can also be individual

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,840
or group speech in front of an audience,

59
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,460
such as a presentation.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,580
Second group is interactive channels of communication.

61
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,280
These are emails, phone calls,

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,000
various social networks or messengers.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,460
Third group is personal static communication.

64
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,220
For instance, you leave a small note on your colleague’s table.

65
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,200
And final group is impersonal static communication static communication,

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,220
such as a report on a project.

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,380
All these kinds of communication are different,

68
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,340
but all of them go through several stages.

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,840
Preparation for communication may be considered as first stage;

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,340
at this stage you define a goal and tasks of future communication for yourself,

71
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,300
gather information and work out behavioral strategy.

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,840
Second stage is planning.

73
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,740
Of course, some business meetings or phone calls may happen spontaneously,

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,420
but nowadays ability to have a clear action plan

75
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,460
is a considered to be common courtesy and attribute of true professionalism.

76
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,380
It means that you agree on time and place of a meeting

77
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,080
or report submission in advance;

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,740
you think out what you are going to say or write,

79
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
which arguments will state;

80
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,560
and you also understand what you are aiming at,

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
and what result you will get.

82
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
And final stage,

83
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,100
typical mainly for first two groups,

84
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,200
is a discussion of relevant issues and working out of some decisions.

85
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,640
during phone conversation, business correspondence

86
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,140
and business communication on social networks and messengers.

87
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,580
Smart business discussion over the phone

88
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,200
is a complicated and very important means of communication,

89
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,920
and it has its own peculiarities.

90
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,260
Your opponent at the end of the line cannot see your mimics,

91
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,300
gestures, emotions and generally how you look.

92
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,100
This is why verbal communication becomes especially important.

93
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,960
I mean, what you say and how you say it.

94
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,100
Unfortunately, many people make some common mistakes

95
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,340
that reduce efficiency of business discussion over the phone.

96
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,220
What kind of mistakes are these in particular?

97
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,220
An untimely call,

98
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,200
a call without consideration of time differences,

99
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,880
especially if you talk to the colleagues from other countries,

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,920
not concerted call time,

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,540
when you just did not agree on particular time,

102
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,780
you call, and your opponent is out of the coverage area or simply cannot speak at that moment.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,120
Another important mistake

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
is poorly thought-out conversation plan.

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,760
Trust me, silence or mumbling irritates a lot.

106
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,880
So, what rules of business phone communication are there?

107
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,320
First – and the most important – 

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,780
is to greet your opponent and introduce yourself,

109
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,540
of course, if it’s not you colleague

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,040
that you talk to everyday.

111
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,320
Also, when speaking Russian, psychologists

112
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,620
recommend to use “Dobry den’” as greeting, instead of “zdravsvuite”,

113
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,000
just because the latter word has too many consonants

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,800
that complicate perception of the word.

115
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Also, try to avoid phrases “good morning” or “good evening”,

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,260
just because it is assumed

117
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,660
that business communication is held during daytime.

118
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,020
Life hack:

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,020
What if the call went dead?

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,280
If your phone call goes dead in the middle of conversation all of a sudden,

121
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,580
the one who initiated the call should call back.

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,920
Second rule: do not apologize or speak about bothering your opponent.

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,240
In the beginning of the call many people say:

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,540
“Excuse me for bothering…”,

125
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,800
don’t do that.

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,020
Just because from the very beginning

127
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,100
you cause rejection,

128
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,440
anxiety and displeasure in your opponent.

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,000
Also, you should not apologize for wasting time of your opponent in the end of conversation.

130
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,740
It will show him/her that you:

131
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,500
a) do not value his/her time;

132
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
b) are not self-confident.

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,260
Much better to use gratitude phrases,

134
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,540
such as “thank you for your time”.

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
Life hack:

136
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,240
smile!

137
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,140
Seriously, try to smile more during your phone conversation,

138
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,980
even though the opponent cannot see you.

139
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,320
In fact, your smile and positive emotions

140
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,780
give respective intonations to your voice.

141
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,000
It becomes more attractive, magnetic;

142
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,780
no one wants to talk to a depressive person,

143
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,540
who is unhappy with the work

144
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
and doesn’t even try to conceal it.

145
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,280
You should have learnt a lot about business correspondence from previous lectures,

146
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,840
this is why I will just shortly mention

147
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,180
main important ethical points of electronic correspondence.

148
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,520
So, it is worth mentioning

149
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,100
that email is usually used to establish initial contact,

150
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,960
meaning for sending an enquiry.

151
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,320
Also, the rule of mutual respect

152
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
should work during electronic correspondence.

153
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,040
This means that you should allow your opponent

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
to choose time for reply.

155
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
However,

156
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,820
all business emails should be replied during one,

157
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,560
maximum two days.

158
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,260
If you are away during longer period,

159
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,500
you should use automatic reply system,

160
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,280
and let people know until

161
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,580
when your will not be able to check your emails.

162
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,520
So, here are the rules of business electronic correspondence:

163
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,440
First of all, I strongly recommend

164
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,840
you to create a separate email address for business purposes.

165
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,640
Usually business email address includes the name of the organization

166
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,400
where you work or its domain,

167
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
and your first and last names.

168
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,780
Please,

169
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,340
do not use “-ish” words,

170
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,020
nicknames, your birth year, and so on.

171
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,680
You should not send your CV to a company

172
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,140
that you would like to get employed at

173
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,540
from email address donut1995@mail.ru.

174
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,140
I have a good advice for you:

175
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,920
you may always create an email address on itmo.ru domain.

176
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,640
Secondly,

177
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,660
you should always start your email with an address to some particular person,

178
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,380
or use “Dear colleagues”.

179
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,140
Your email should not be unaddressed.

180
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,860
Also, your signature with your name and contact details

181
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,480
should be stated in the end of your email.

182
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,720
Do not forget to fill out Theme field.

183
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,920
Also, if you have a long chain of email,

184
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,640
and Theme field includes multiple “Re:Re:Re:Re”,

185
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,500
you may stop this chain,

186
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,620
and start a new one, and quote main points

187
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,300
of previous conversation.

188
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,620
If you send an email with attachments,

189
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,420
please,

190
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,420
mention this in the text of your email.

191
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,900
Also, attachments should be named clearly,

192
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,560
so that the addressee could easily understand what’s in there.

193
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,400
When you are ready to send your email, please,

194
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,300
read it once again,

195
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,000
or even twice.

196
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,100
Because simple literacy

197
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,500
is not just a big bonus to your professional image,

198
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,540
but also a sign of respect to your opponent or colleague.

199
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,700
And in the end of this lecture I would like to mention some rules of communication in social networks.

200
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,920
Ethics of communication in social networks and messengers is not explicit.

201
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,900
However, there are several generally accepted and used rules.

202
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,820
Firstly, remember that your profile in social networks is your public image

203
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,340
that your colleagues, supervisors, and potential employers

204
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,800
can see to gather some information about you, 

205
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,860
or, for instance, to initiate informal communication.

206
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,060
“Oh, this one is a cat lover, and that one has a country house in Sestroretsk”

207
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,360
… so try to create your positive image in social networks.

208
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,840
Secondly, as a rule, social networks and messengers are used by colleagues

209
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,540
who are on good terms and communicate frequently.

210
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,740
Alternatively, social networks can be used while working on some short-term projects,

211
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,220
requiring constant communication.

212
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,600
One should not write to a superior colleague in social networks first.

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Thirdly, try to write briefly.

214
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,540
Format of messengers itself does not imply long texts.

215
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,400
Also, try to avoid using expletives

216
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
or generally useless words.

217
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,240
Do not neglect formatting and editing functions.

218
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,460
Remember that it is still business communication, and you need to write grammatically right. 

219
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,620
Another important rule:

220
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,760
do not send messages outside regular office hours.

221
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,680
For business communication social networks should be used only in office hours.

222
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,780
Just because, unlike email,

223
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,140
they have format

224
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,400
implying permanent staying in touch.

225
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,720
This is why we can receive and see these kinds of messages 24/7,

226
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,800
and getting a work message early in the morning or late in the night is not pleasant.

227
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,700
And the last life hack:

228
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,420
Do not write down or make any serious decisions

229
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,500
in a social network or messenger conversation.

230
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
There are personal meetings, negotiations

231
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,900
or, in a pinch, electronic correspondence for this.

232
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,540
If you discuss some important project in messenger,

233
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,120
you should additionally write down main points

234
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,820
in a separate email.

235
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,180
This is the end of our lecture.

236
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,020
Thank you for your attention!

237
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,580
Remember, following these rules of business etiquette

238
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,700
will make your life easier and more comfortable.

239
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
