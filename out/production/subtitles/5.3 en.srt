00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello, this is Natalya Khokhlova.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,140
We are continuing to move forward to our dream job.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,520
Today we are going to talk with you about the second stage

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,000
of the selection of candidates for most of the existing vacancies.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,140
This stage is the stage of interviewing.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,840
You have probably already studied the previous lecture

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,580
in which one we have talked about

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,780
creating your CV/

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,780
You have taken into account all our recommendations

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,820
and as a result you have such a unique resume,

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,080
after reading which your potential employer

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,560
has decided to get to know you better.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Now you can expect a call.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,820
A company representative will call you soon

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
and will set an interviewing date.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,740
Keep in mind that this call is not just a formality,

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,420
but can result in a phone interview,

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,420
which will be an intermediate stage

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,840
between your CV and personal meeting.

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
That is why you need to be

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,840
well-prepared for this stage.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,660
So, try to provide optimal conditions for your call.

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,200
Make sure, that there is no ambient noises and distraction

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
so you can learn all the information

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,080
you are provided with and ask questions.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
Sometimes the interviewing is held

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
in a written form by email.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,640
In this case, watching our lecture

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,320
about business correspondence and

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,680
considering the main principles of a business letter,

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,940
you can safely organize your interviewing

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,940
in such a way of communication.

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,020
So, you already have a date, time and place

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,900
of your future interview.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,220
What to do now,

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,420
how to act,

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,560
how to prepare

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,720
and what to pay attention to?

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,500
The major part of your success

40
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,260
depends on your level of preparation.

41
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,500
Before the meeting  try to find out

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,900
as much information as possible

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,180
about the company, what the company does,

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,940
what clients and partners it has,

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
what growth opportunities it has,

46
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,540
its development plans,

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,660
what requirements the company presents

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,940
to candidates for vacancies that are available.

49
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,940
And what is the most important,

50
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,420
try to find out all possible information

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,540
about your vacancy.

52
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,540
Analyze once more time

53
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,760
what kind of your knowledge and skills

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,300
could be useful for a company.

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,040
Having examined the company in turn

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,700
you may find out how it could be useful for you

57
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,680
and how it can be of interest

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,480
to you professionally.

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,260
Your appearance is an important part

60
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,460
of a successful interview.

61
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,120
The proverb “clothes make the man”

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,880
is the best approach.

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,560
Conservative style will be appropriate.

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,160
But there we need to note,

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,560
that if your work implies working with people,

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,540
communicating with clients and partners,

67
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,540
you should opt for more formal style of clothes.

68
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
On the other hand,

69
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,540
if you are applying for some kind of creative job,

70
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,540
you should not adhere to the formal clothes.

71
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,820
Imagine, however, how frustrating it can be

72
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
when you tell your conversation partner about

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,100
some very important professional achievement,

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,260
but they don’t listen to you

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
reading the inscriptions

76
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,220
on your T-shirt instead,

77
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,960
translating them or trying them on

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,200
to see if they fit you in some way

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,420
or if they may somehow belong to a recruiter.

80
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,760
Thus, T-shirts with inscriptions

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
should be put aside for another occasion.

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
As for other meetings,

83
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,040
, arrive to your interview on time.

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,040
It will be optimal to come

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,580
10-15 minutes earlier.

86
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,180
It will be good if you have

87
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,580
contact information of the person

88
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,580
you are going to meet.

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Then you'll be able to inform them

90
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
if you arrive too early

91
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,920
or are being late.

92
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,420
The most important rule

93
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,420
during the conversation

94
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,700
is the rule of honesty and openness.

95
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Remember, the interview is the process

96
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,860
where both participants

97
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,860
are interested in the outcome.

98
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,300
You're interested in getting this job.

99
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,040
Your counterpart is interested

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
in filling the vacancy,

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,260
finding a decent and professional candidate.

102
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,940
Therefore, if you plan to find

103
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,940
a job for yourself,

104
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,580
if you plan to work in this company

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,580
for a sufficient amount of time,

106
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,140
it is sensible to speak openly

107
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,080
about your knowledge, your skills

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,660
and to voice your expectations

109
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,940
from the company.

110
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,740
Do not be afraid to ask questions.

111
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,440
You can ask some clarifying questions

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
and it wouldn’t be redundant

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
even to take a notebook and a pen

114
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
to take some notes.

115
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,940
Answering questions try to avoid

116
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,760
simple answers, such as “yes” or “no”.

117
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,300
However, very detailed answers

118
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,540
in the format of a monologue

119
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,620
are also better left

120
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,620
for a more informal conversation.

121
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Remember, not only you

122
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,960
want to know more about the company,

123
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,280
but also a company wants to know you.

124
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,640
At the end of interviewing

125
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,940
it is vital to discuss the feedback.

126
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,480
Usually,  professional recruiters

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,140
say it by themselves,

128
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,220
when and in which way

129
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,620
they will contact you

130
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
– by phone or e-mail.

131
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,300
If for some reason

132
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,800
you have not been told this information,

133
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,920
you can clarify it by yourself.

134
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,780
The most important thing to remember

135
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,780
when interviewing is

136
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,160
that in any case, you win.

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,080
You either get invaluable experience

138
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,100
of self-presentation and passing interviews,

139
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,480
or you get the dream job.

140
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,940
I wish you good preparation,

141
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,080
decent vacancies and interesting interviews.

142
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Good luck and see you

143
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
at our next video lectures!
