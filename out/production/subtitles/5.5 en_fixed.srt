1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Good afternoon dear students.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,280
Today we start a series of lectures, devoted to business and scientific ethics.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,380
First mini-lecture will be devoted to business communication ethics.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,500
We will discuss what business communication is,

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,940
what types of business communication exist,

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,240
and what rules need to be followed while having business correspondence,

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,080
phone discussion and communication in social networks.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,540
So, what is business communication?

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,960
In a nutshell, business communication

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,080
is interaction in professional environment

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,860
for dealing with work matters or tasks.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,600
To make business communication effective

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,220
and generally reasonable,

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,500
one should follow several rules:

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,720
First of all, any communication should have its goal,

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,320
and all participants should be interested in it.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,840
For example, it could be negotiations,

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,540
signing an agreement,

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,880
establishing relations, or an event organization.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,960
Second condition of business communication is observing business etiquette,

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
subordination, professional roles,

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,620
and formal boundaries.

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,280
Under formal boundaries I imply

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,280
compliance with various protocols, regulations,

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
as well as simple necessity to control your emotions

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,400
and respect your partners and colleagues.

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,860
So, efficient communication.

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,180
This is how it works:

29
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,160
Firstly, 

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,260
we need to choose 

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,600
right means or channel of communication.

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,880
Secondly,

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,800
you should stick to particular format,

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
fitting into this channel of communication.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,540
Thirdly,

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,200
you should also abide by universal rules,

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,360
such as respect, literacy, benevolence,

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,680
kind attitude towards your colleagues and partners.

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,640
Believe me, compliance with formal and informal rules of business communication

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
makes interaction with people much easier

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,980
and creates comfortable environment at work with your colleagues.

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,860
Life hack:

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,620
if you initiate business communication,

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,080
it is your task to choose channel of communication,

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
for example, business correspondence,

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,320
and suggest it to your partner or colleague.

47
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,300
In the opposite situation, when your colleague has sent you a request,

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,480
for example, in form of email,

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,980
you should support this choice of communication channel,

50
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,380
and reply in the same style and form.

51
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,160
There are several kinds of communication channels.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,060
In fact, all of them may be divided into four groups.

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,980
First one is related to communication

54
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,600
that requires personal presence of all parties.

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,260
For example, it can be personal face-to-face discussion, such as an interview.

56
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,280
It can be a group meeting, such as a staff meeting or negotiations.

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,880
It can also be individual

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,840
or group speech in front of an audience,

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,460
such as a presentation.

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,580
Second group is interactive channels of communication.

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,280
These are emails, phone calls,

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
various social networks or messengers.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,460
Third group is personal static communication.

64
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,220
For instance, you leave a small note on your colleague’s table.

65
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,200
And final group is impersonal static communication static communication,

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,220
such as a report on a project.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,380
All these kinds of communication are different,

68
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,340
but all of them go through several stages.

69
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,840
Preparation for communication may be considered as first stage;

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,340
at this stage you define a goal and tasks of future communication for yourself,

71
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,300
gather information and work out behavioral strategy.

72
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,840
Second stage is planning.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,740
Of course, some business meetings or phone calls may happen spontaneously,

74
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,420
but nowadays ability to have a clear action plan

75
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:18,460
is a considered to be common courtesy and attribute of true professionalism.

76
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,380
It means that you agree on time and place of a meeting

77
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,080
or report submission in advance;

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,740
you think out what you are going to say or write,

79
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
which arguments will state;

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,560
and you also understand what you are aiming at,

81
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
and what result you will get.

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
And final stage,

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,100
typical mainly for first two groups,

84
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,200
is a discussion of relevant issues and working out of some decisions.

85
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,640
during phone conversation, business correspondence

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,140
and business communication on social networks and messengers.

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,580
Smart business discussion over the phone

88
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,200
is a complicated and very important means of communication,

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,920
and it has its own peculiarities.

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,260
Your opponent at the end of the line cannot see your mimics,

91
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,300
gestures, emotions and generally how you look.

92
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,100
This is why verbal communication becomes especially important.

93
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,960
I mean, what you say and how you say it.

94
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Unfortunately, many people make some common mistakes

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,340
that reduce efficiency of business discussion over the phone.

96
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,220
What kind of mistakes are these in particular?

97
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
An untimely call,

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,200
a call without consideration of time differences,

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,880
especially if you talk to the colleagues from other countries,

100
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,920
not concerted call time,

101
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,540
when you just did not agree on particular time,

102
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,780
you call, and your opponent is out of the coverage area or simply cannot speak at that moment.

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
Another important mistake

104
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
is poorly thought-out conversation plan.

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
Trust me, silence or mumbling irritates a lot.

106
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,880
So, what rules of business phone communication are there?

107
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,320
First – and the most important – 

108
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,780
is to greet your opponent and introduce yourself,

109
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,540
of course, if it’s not you colleague

110
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,040
that you talk to everyday.

111
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,320
Also, when speaking Russian, psychologists

112
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,620
recommend to use “Dobry den’” as greeting, instead of “zdravsvuite”,

113
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,000
just because the latter word has too many consonants

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,800
that complicate perception of the word.

115
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Also, try to avoid phrases “good morning” or “good evening”,

116
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,260
just because it is assumed

117
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,660
that business communication is held during daytime.

118
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,020
Life hack:

119
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What if the call went dead?

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,280
If your phone call goes dead in the middle of conversation all of a sudden,

121
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,580
the one who initiated the call should call back.

122
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,920
Second rule: do not apologize or speak about bothering your opponent.

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,240
In the beginning of the call many people say:

124
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,540
“Excuse me for bothering…”,

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,800
don’t do that.

126
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,020
Just because from the very beginning

127
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,100
you cause rejection,

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,440
anxiety and displeasure in your opponent.

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,000
Also, you should not apologize for wasting time of your opponent in the end of conversation.

130
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,740
It will show him/her that you:

131
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,500
a) do not value his/her time;

132
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
b) are not self-confident.

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,260
Much better to use gratitude phrases,

134
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,540
such as “thank you for your time”.

135
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,240
Life hack:

136
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,240
smile!

137
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,140
Seriously, try to smile more during your phone conversation,

138
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,980
even though the opponent cannot see you.

139
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,320
In fact, your smile and positive emotions

140
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,780
give respective intonations to your voice.

141
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,000
It becomes more attractive, magnetic;

142
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,780
no one wants to talk to a depressive person,

143
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,540
who is unhappy with the work

144
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
and doesn’t even try to conceal it.

145
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,280
You should have learnt a lot about business correspondence from previous lectures,

146
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,840
this is why I will just shortly mention

147
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,180
main important ethical points of electronic correspondence.

148
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,520
So, it is worth mentioning

149
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,100
that email is usually used to establish initial contact,

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,960
meaning for sending an enquiry.

151
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,320
Also, the rule of mutual respect

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
should work during electronic correspondence.

153
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,040
This means that you should allow your opponent

154
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
to choose time for reply.

155
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
However,

156
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,820
all business emails should be replied during one,

157
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,560
maximum two days.

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,260
If you are away during longer period,

159
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,500
you should use automatic reply system,

160
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,280
and let people know until

161
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,580
when your will not be able to check your emails.

162
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,520
So, here are the rules of business electronic correspondence:

163
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,440
First of all, I strongly recommend

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,840
you to create a separate email address for business purposes.

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,640
Usually business email address includes the name of the organization

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,400
where you work or its domain,

167
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
and your first and last names.

168
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,780
Please,

169
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,340
do not use “-ish” words,

170
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,020
nicknames, your birth year, and so on.

171
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,680
You should not send your CV to a company

172
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,140
that you would like to get employed at

173
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,540
from email address donut1995@mail.ru.

174
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,140
I have a good advice for you:

175
00:09:56,140 --> 00:01:00,920
you may always create an email address on itmo.ru domain.

176
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,640
Secondly,

177
00:01:03,640 --> 00:10:11,660
you should always start your email with an address to some particular person,

178
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,380
or use “Dear colleagues”.

179
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,140
Your email should not be unaddressed.

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,860
Also, your signature with your name and contact details

181
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,480
should be stated in the end of your email.

182
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,720
Do not forget to fill out Theme field.

183
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,920
Also, if you have a long chain of email,

184
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,640
and Theme field includes multiple “Re:Re:Re:Re”,

185
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,500
you may stop this chain,

186
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,620
and start a new one, and quote main points

187
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,300
of previous conversation.

188
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,620
If you send an email with attachments,

189
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,420
please,

190
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,420
mention this in the text of your email.

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,900
Also, attachments should be named clearly,

192
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,560
so that the addressee could easily understand what’s in there.

193
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,400
When you are ready to send your email, please,

194
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,300
read it once again,

195
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,000
or even twice.

196
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,100
Because simple literacy

197
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,500
is not just a big bonus to your professional image,

198
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,540
but also a sign of respect to your opponent or colleague.

199
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,700
And in the end of this lecture I would like to mention some rules of communication in social networks.

200
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,920
Ethics of communication in social networks and messengers is not explicit.

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,900
However, there are several generally accepted and used rules.

202
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,820
Firstly, remember that your profile in social networks is your public image

203
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,340
that your colleagues, supervisors, and potential employers

204
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,800
can see to gather some information about you, 

205
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,860
or, for instance, to initiate informal communication.

206
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,060
“Oh, this one is a cat lover, and that one has a country house in Sestroretsk”

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,360
… so try to create your positive image in social networks.

208
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,840
Secondly, as a rule, social networks and messengers are used by colleagues

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,540
who are on good terms and communicate frequently.

210
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,740
Alternatively, social networks can be used while working on some short-term projects,

211
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,220
requiring constant communication.

212
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,600
One should not write to a superior colleague in social networks first.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Thirdly, try to write briefly.

214
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,540
Format of messengers itself does not imply long texts.

215
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,400
Also, try to avoid using expletives

216
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
or generally useless words.

217
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,240
Do not neglect formatting and editing functions.

218
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,460
Remember that it is still business communication, and you need to write grammatically right. 

219
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
Another important rule:

220
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,760
do not send messages outside regular office hours.

221
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,680
For business communication social networks should be used only in office hours.

222
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,780
Just because, unlike email,

223
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,140
they have format

224
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:29,400
implying permanent staying in touch.

225
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
This is why we can receive and see these kinds of messages 24/7,

226
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,800
and getting a work message early in the morning or late in the night is not pleasant.

227
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,700
And the last life hack:

228
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,420
Do not write down or make any serious decisions

229
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,500
in a social network or messenger conversation.

230
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,280
There are personal meetings, negotiations

231
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,900
or, in a pinch, electronic correspondence for this.

232
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,540
If you discuss some important project in messenger,

233
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,120
you should additionally write down main points

234
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,820
in a separate email.

235
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,180
This is the end of our lecture.

236
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,020
Thank you for your attention!

237
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,580
Remember, following these rules of business etiquette

238
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,700
will make your life easier and more comfortable.

239
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
