00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, I am Iliya Kuftiryov. Today we will talk about rankings.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Rankings are a very popular topic nowadays.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,600
And in this module I would like to tell you about universities’ rankings.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,000
Of course, it is impossible to discuss all existing rankings.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,700
There are several dozens of rankings in the world.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,600
This is why I would like to point our three main academic rankings.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
These are QS ranking, Times Higher Education ranking,

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
both of them are originally British,

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,200
and another one is Shanghai Ranking, which is also called Academic Ranking of World Universities.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,800
All three rankings are international and world-wide, but they have different goals and objectives.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,700
They are very popular recently, and I am sure that university applicants, including those in Russia,

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,300
take these rankings into consideration when making decision about which university to choose.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,623
Also, the government decides how to support universities,

14
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:06,800
based on their positions in rankings.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,000
For you to feel more confident in the topic,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,100
I want to tell you right away that information on which indicators form methodology of these

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,200
three rankings you can find in the supplementary files for the module.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,300
In order not to consider every indicator in details, as it would have been a very boring story,

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,000
I would like to gather all indicators of academic rankings in three groups.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,500
One of these groups is directly related to soft skills.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,000
One of these groups is directly related to soft skills.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,100
Ranking agency takes the information, let’s say,

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,400
from the official website of a university, and based on this it calculates some indicators.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,200
For example, percentage of foreign students, percentage of foreign professors,

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,500
and this way the agency uses these results for making ranking tables.

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Alternatively, the university gives this

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,200
information and statistics itself, and the results are calculated the same way.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,000
The second group is so called scientometric indicators.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In particular, let’s consider citations indicator, which is called Hirsch index,

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
my colleague Daniil Shirokov has already told you about Hirsch index.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,700
So in QS and Times Higher Education the citation indicator,

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,400
which is a normalized citation indicator, is used.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:45,900
This indicator takes into consideration publication type, scientific field and year of publication –

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,400
all these parameters are taken into account in rankings.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
And finally, the third group of indicators, the one that is related

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
to soft skills, is so called reputational indicators.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,300
For example, in QS ranking, recognizability of a university makes

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,700
up to 50% of the final result.

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Let’s note this once again, 50% of the result that a university gets in the

40
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,200
ranking is determined by its reputation and recognizability.

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,900
In Times Higher Education ranking it makes up approximately 1/3 of the result.

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,600
In Shanghai ranking there is no reputation indicator, but there are others

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,300
that you can check, and they are not directly related to reputation.

44
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,600
Here is the second aspect – what is the connection between the university’s reputation, its recognizability and your soft skills.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,500
You may be surprised, but it is not direct, of course, it is not functional,

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,600
but I would say, there is correlation, and quite a strong one.

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,300
Look what I mean.

48
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,000
I hope that you are not in the very beginning of your way, but you have already

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,800
started your scientific research, and have written your scientific publication.

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,300
When it is published, it is not the end of the way,

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,000
you should keep promoting the results of your research,

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,900
visit scientific conferences, participate in international networking,

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,900
present these results to your colleagues, to other research groups,

54
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,000
be involved into academic community, scientific community,

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,500
a part of which every scientists wants to be,

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,000
especially now, in our small world, where everyone knows each other,

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,400
if we are talking about one sphere, everyone communicates with each other actively,

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,900
but this is that very community where, I am sure, you will find your well-deserved place.

59
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:59,000
Speaking about communicative skills, that is a part of soft skills,

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,500
speaking about the possibility and necessity to talk about your scientific results,

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,800
disseminate them, present to the public, these are your actions

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,800
that in the end of the day will make you organization,

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,900
your university more recognizable,

64
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,900
people will become better familiarized with what you do,

65
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,400
and you can expect that when they participate in the expert survey,

66
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,600
held by both QS and Times Higher Education, possibly these people,

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,700
who know you and the results of your research, will tell the whole world that your

68
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,100
university and your research group, having particularly you in mind,

69
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,600
they will tell the world that this university is advanced

70
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,300
in this or that field of scientific research.

71
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,400
This is why you should not neglect these opportunities, do share your findings, share your discoveries,

72
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,900
participate actively in international networking,

73
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,300
and in the long run it will influence the ranking position of your university.

74
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,100
To conclude I would like to note that, of course, rankings

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,800
facilitate the university brand forming and developing.

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Perhaps, someone will see the reverse logic in here.

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,700
Universities are fully developed brands, and this is why they have good positions in rankings,

78
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,000
but it is not the causality that matters here, but the fact

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that thanks to the university you get a unique opportunity to

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,500
develop, improve and make more recognizable your own

81
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,800
scientific brand, your own scientific style.

82
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:00,699
I wish you success in this, and do read the rankings, study the rankings and develop your soft skills!
