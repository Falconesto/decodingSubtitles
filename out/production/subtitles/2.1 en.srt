00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, my name is Inna Anokhina. And today we begin the substantive part of our course,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we are going to talk about scientific publications, as it’s impossible 

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to imagine a modern scientist not reading or writing scientific articles. 

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
As for the scientific text, it should be short and clear,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
also from the point of view of the use of linguistic means, not to confuse the reader and not to be ambiguous.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In the modern world, all scientific articles are written according to the structure 

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
adopted by the American National Standards Institute in 1972. 

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It’s interesting that the first scientific work which had an IMRAD structure

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
was that of Louis Pasteur. IMRAD is an abbreviation 

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that translates into Russian as "introduction, methods, results and discussion".

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All scientific articles are written according to this structure, so today

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we will consider the structure of any scientific research article.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Of course, when you see an article or start working on an article, 

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the first thing you think about is the title. 

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The title of a scientific article should not be long; 

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
it should consist of 8-10 words, not including prepositions and conjunctions, 

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and attract the attention of your audience. 

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It is clear that in the process of working on the article, 

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
its title may change, 

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
however you still need to come up with a working version. 

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
After the article, you need to specify 

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the author or group of co-authors of the article. 

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You need to specify everyone’s names, initials, titles, 

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
degrees, places of work or study and countries. 

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
However, be careful, because the requirements

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
differ from journal to journal 

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and before you fill out information about the author or authors, 

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you need to coordinate it with the requirements of the journal.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In the third place there is the abstract. 

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Despite the fact that the abstract comes immediately after the title 

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and the list of authors or the author, it is often written at the very end. 

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It’s created after the article is already written and the study was conducted. 

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The abstract is also used to attract the readers’ attention.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It is a single paragraph which consists of 250-300 words

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and corresponds, in fact, to the structure 

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to which the article corresponds, 

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that is, indicates the subject and the method of the research. 

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Also you should not use abbreviations 

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and numeric values in your abstract. 

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Despite the fact that the abstract is in the first place, almost in the first place, 

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the abstract is written at the very end of the study and work. 

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That is this is the last part you are working on.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then you need to formulate a list of keywords. 

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There should not be many keywords and should not be few. 

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Usually authors allocate from 4 to 8 keywords, and keywords are used 

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
to search for your article in international publication databases. 

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
After that the main part of the article begins. 

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It occupies, in general, 80 per cent of the volume

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of any scientific text of this type. 

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And we will discuss now the introduction, methods, results and discussion.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
As it is clear, the introduction introduces the reader

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
into the problems you are dealing with. 

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In the introduction, you review the literature in this field, 

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
in the introduction, you point out those blind spots

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that exist in this field or

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that have not yet been investigated before you. 

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
At the end, you formulate the purpose and objectives of your research.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then, in the methods section, you describe the research methodology, 

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and describe it as carefully as you can and in great details. 

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The research methodology should be described in such a way

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that a specialist in the field could reproduce 

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
your experiment and get the same results

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that you received in your laboratory. 

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It should be noted that readers are 

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
unlikely to read this section, 

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
because you have already mentioned in the introduction, 

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
which method you used. 

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
However, this section is very important, because the reviewer 

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
will surely read it, read the methodology 

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and, if he has doubts about the possibility of reproducing

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the experiment in the laboratory, 

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
then your article will, at best, 

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
be sent to you for revision, 

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in the worst case the publication will be rejected.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The next section that we will discuss with you

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is the results section.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Here you describe the results 

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
of your experiment and present them in the form of tables, 

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
graphs, diagrams, photographs and drawings. 

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You describe the results, compare, and give a brief comment.

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The next section is the discussion. 

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If the previous section dealt with facts,

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 this section deals with ideas. 

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You describe your idea, you relate 

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 the results to your hypothesis, and you talk about 

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
whether you have achieved your goal and whether the tasks have been completed.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can also mention limiting factors. 

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
As a matter of fact, this section is a generalization 

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 of all your work on the one hand. 

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And on the other hand, it is this section 

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
that connects your own results, which you received 

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
as a result of the experiment with the real world,

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
with the fact where and how the results 

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
of your research can be applied.

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
After you give the prospect for 

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
future research in the discussion section,

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you need to thank the organization that

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
may have sponsored your research, if any. 

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
After gratitude there is a list of the used literature 

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
in which you need to specify all the sources, 

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
which you referred to in the text of the article.

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You should be very careful again 

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and follow the literature list requirements of the journal,

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you submit your article for the publication to.

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thus, we have considered

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the structure of an article today, 

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and in the next lecture we will consider the process of working on a text.
