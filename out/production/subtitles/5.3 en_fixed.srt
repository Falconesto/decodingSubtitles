00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello, this is Natalya Khokhlova.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,140
We are continuing to move forward to our dream job.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,520
Today we are going to talk with you about the second stage

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,000
of the selection of candidates for most of the existing vacancies.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,140
This stage is the stage of interviewing.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,840
You have probably already studied the previous lecture

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,580
in which one we have talked about

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,780
creating your CV/

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,780
You have taken into account all our recommendations

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,820
and as a result you have such a unique resume,

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,080
after reading which your potential employer

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,560
has decided to get to know you better.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,560
Now you can expect a call.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,820
A company representative will call you soon

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
and will set an interviewing date.

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,740
Keep in mind that this call is not just a formality,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,420
but can result in a phone interview,

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
which will be an intermediate stage

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,840
between your CV and personal meeting.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,840
That is why you need to be

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
well-prepared for this stage.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,660
So, try to provide optimal conditions for your call.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,200
Make sure, that there is no ambient noises and distraction

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
so you can learn all the information

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,080
you are provided with and ask questions.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,360
Sometimes the interviewing is held

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
in a written form by email.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,640
In this case, watching our lecture

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
about business correspondence and

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,680
considering the main principles of a business letter,

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,940
you can safely organize your interviewing

32
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
in such a way of communication.

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,020
So, you already have a date, time and place

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,900
of your future interview.

35
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,220
What to do now,

36
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,420
how to act,

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,560
how to prepare

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,720
and what to pay attention to?

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,500
The major part of your success

40
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,260
depends on your level of preparation.

41
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,500
Before the meeting  try to find out

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,900
as much information as possible

43
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,180
about the company, what the company does,

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,940
what clients and partners it has,

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,940
what growth opportunities it has,

46
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,540
its development plans,

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,660
what requirements the company presents

48
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,940
to candidates for vacancies that are available.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,940
And what is the most important,

50
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,420
try to find out all possible information

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,540
about your vacancy.

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Analyze once more time

53
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,760
what kind of your knowledge and skills

54
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,300
could be useful for a company.

55
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,040
Having examined the company in turn

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,700
you may find out how it could be useful for you

57
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,680
and how it can be of interest

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,480
to you professionally.

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,260
Your appearance is an important part

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,460
of a successful interview.

61
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,120
The proverb “clothes make the man”

62
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,880
is the best approach.

63
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,560
Conservative style will be appropriate.

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,160
But there we need to note,

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,560
that if your work implies working with people,

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,540
communicating with clients and partners,

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,540
you should opt for more formal style of clothes.

68
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
On the other hand,

69
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
if you are applying for some kind of creative job,

70
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,540
you should not adhere to the formal clothes.

71
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,820
Imagine, however, how frustrating it can be

72
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
when you tell your conversation partner about

73
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,100
some very important professional achievement,

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,260
but they don’t listen to you

75
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
reading the inscriptions

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,220
on your T-shirt instead,

77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,960
translating them or trying them on

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
to see if they fit you in some way

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,420
or if they may somehow belong to a recruiter.

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,760
Thus, T-shirts with inscriptions

81
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
should be put aside for another occasion.

82
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
As for other meetings,

83
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,040
, arrive to your interview on time.

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
It will be optimal to come

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,580
10-15 minutes earlier.

86
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,180
It will be good if you have

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,580
contact information of the person

88
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
you are going to meet.

89
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
Then you'll be able to inform them

90
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
if you arrive too early

91
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,920
or are being late.

92
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,420
The most important rule

93
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
during the conversation

94
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,700
is the rule of honesty and openness.

95
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Remember, the interview is the process

96
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,860
where both participants

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
are interested in the outcome.

98
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,300
You're interested in getting this job.

99
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,040
Your counterpart is interested

100
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
in filling the vacancy,

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,260
finding a decent and professional candidate.

102
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,940
Therefore, if you plan to find

103
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
a job for yourself,

104
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,580
if you plan to work in this company

105
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,580
for a sufficient amount of time,

106
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,140
it is sensible to speak openly

107
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,080
about your knowledge, your skills

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,660
and to voice your expectations

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,940
from the company.

110
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,740
Do not be afraid to ask questions.

111
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,440
You can ask some clarifying questions

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
and it wouldn’t be redundant

113
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
even to take a notebook and a pen

114
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,880
to take some notes.

115
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,940
Answering questions try to avoid

116
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,760
simple answers, such as “yes” or “no”.

117
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,300
However, very detailed answers

118
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,540
in the format of a monologue

119
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,620
are also better left

120
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
for a more informal conversation.

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Remember, not only you

122
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,960
want to know more about the company,

123
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
but also a company wants to know you.

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,640
At the end of interviewing

125
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,940
it is vital to discuss the feedback.

126
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,480
Usually,  professional recruiters

127
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,140
say it by themselves,

128
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,220
when and in which way

129
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,620
they will contact you

130
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
– by phone or e-mail.

131
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300
If for some reason

132
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,800
you have not been told this information,

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,920
you can clarify it by yourself.

134
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,780
The most important thing to remember

135
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
when interviewing is

136
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,160
that in any case, you win.

137
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,080
You either get invaluable experience

138
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,100
of self-presentation and passing interviews,

139
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,480
or you get the dream job.

140
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,940
I wish you good preparation,

141
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,080
decent vacancies and interesting interviews.

142
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Good luck and see you

143
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
at our next video lectures!
