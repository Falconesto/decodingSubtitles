00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Dear students, we have already learned
different time and energy management
techniques.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,900
Today I want to talk to you
about attention management.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:22,800
Harvard university psychologists have
conducted some research, the results of
which show, that we spend 47% of awake
time dreaming.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,300
Thus, instead of focusing on
important tasks our brain is dispersed and
unfocused.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,800
Let’s inspect the mistakes we make while
working

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,200
and learn how to carefully manage
our attention.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,700
Mistake №1 – trying to keep everything in
your head.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Every bit of information not written or
otherwise stored on an external device takes
up room in our short-term memory and
steals our attention.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,400
Our brain is an
extremely powerful tool and it can process a
lot of information, but it cannot store the
vast amounts of information we pour into
our brains.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,700
Usually we do not write down
simple tasks such as “Buy some bread” or
“Call travel agency” but instead try to
remember them all.

11
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,800
This leads to tense
moments when you are trying to figure out
what exactly you have forgotten

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,200
or trying to
recall it right now, distracting yourself from
current work.

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,500
Solution:

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,700
1. Write down your tasks and goals. This will
allow you to free up your memory and make
you more organized.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,300
2. Put all your meetings on your calendar as this will allow you to receive notifications about upcoming events.

16
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,500
3. Make shopping lists before going shopping.

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,500
4. Write down all your ideas, as they tend to disappear into subconsciousness .

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,600
and when they reappear, they may seem new to you

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,300
Mistake № 2 - imprecise wording of your tasks.

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Whenever you open your organizer and see a note “Mary”, you are most likely going to think what exactly

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:57,300
you have meant by this note and which Mary it refers to. Making your notes too short makes your brain to work harder.

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,600
On the other hand, a very  long note leads to procrastination.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
Word your notes properly.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,900
1. The task you are writing down should be simple and contain one specific step.

25
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,300
2. Use brief and clear wording.

26
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,400
3. Be sure to state the action you must complete.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Mistake №3 – accumulation of unfinished tasks

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,600
We constantly keep thinking about things we have not done, such as unread letters, unfulfilled promises, phone calls not made

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 – we keep thinking about these tasks and this creates tension, brings us anxiety and steals our attention.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,500
We often tend to feel guilty for our procrastination and that adversely affects our self-control.

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,600
Solution:

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,100
1. Solve simple tasks as soon as possible.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,200
2. Set  deadlines for all of your tasks

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,800
3. Create checklists of all unfulfilled tasks and work on them

35
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:55,825
4. If you decide that you do not want to do a certain task – cross it out

36
00:02:55,825 --> 00:03:01,300
of your list so that you feel better about it and are able to move on.

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,900
5. Organize and clean up your workplace, computer and e-mail.

38
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Now let us talk about mistakes that are more serious.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,400
Mistake № 4 – Multitasking

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Though it is true that most of us can manage several different tasks at the same time,

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,800
our brain can only focus on one particular task.

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Multitasking makes us less productive, we make more mistakes and it often causes more stress throughout the workday.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,400
You also spend more total time on your work as any

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,500
distraction causes you to spend 10-15 extra minutes to regain your concentration.

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,600
Nevertheless, we love multitasking as it offers an illusion of productivity.

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
Solution:

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,200
1. Remind yourself that multitasking only hurts your performance, especially when it comes to mental work.

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,100
2. Concentrate all your attention on one task during a fixed time period

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,300
3. Make other people aware of your being busy

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,300
4. Minimize the amount of possible distractions; turn off all unimportant notifications on your phone and computer.

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,800
5. Try not to accumulate too many important urgent tasks that will distract you from your current work.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Mistake № 5 – Overwhelming your brain with information.

53
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Nowadays we often face enormous amounts of all kinds of information

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,300
and often it is not important for us.

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Excess information decreases your ability to concentrate as well as your cognitive abilities.

56
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,900
Solution:

57
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,100
1. Learn to filter the information you receive and critically observe whether you really need it.

58
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,900
2. Use different kinds of adblocks in your browsers.

59
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,400
3. Clean up your email subscriptions, leave all the unnecessary groups and chats in messengers.

60
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,300
4. Set up a time limit for your internet sessions and control yourself.

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,800
Mistake № 6 – Work overload

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Working long hours without any breaks, mental work during periods of biological decline, working in night – all these

63
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,700
factors tend to decrease your performance and decrease your work speed as well as increase chances of burnout.

64
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,100
Solution:

65
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,800
1. Remind yourself that your brain needs some rest. Quality rest can only be

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,300
achieved via long sleep or moderate physical activity and change of activity.

67
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,500
Work in short cycles of 20-25 minutes. In this lecture’s appendix

68
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,100
 I have shared my favorite technique – The Pomodoro method.

69
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,600
3. Take quality breaks.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,900
4. Keep your sleep schedule.

71
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,400
Finally, Mistake № 7 – Internal distractions

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,500
An important part of your attention resource is being here and now.

73
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,700
We, however, often tend to think about past, present and future tasks and problems at the same time.

74
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,000
Solution:

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,200
1. Keep asking yourself what is important at the moment. Keeping track of

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,200
your current priorities helps you to concentrate on your goals.

77
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:22,500
Work on your emotional state. Negative thoughts and feelings can easily capture you entirely

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,700
and distract you from your work, as we always tend to think about things that worry us the most.

79
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,000
Analyze your emotions carefully and control your mood.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,400
3. Do not forget to praise and reward yourself for your accomplishments. We all need some sort of stimulation to keep us motivated.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,300
Probably you think that it requires a lot of effort to manage your time, energy and attention effectively.

82
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,500
However, it is only true in the beginning, as quite soon new methods

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,200
and ways of managing your time will turn into habits and it will make your life a lot easier.

84
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,800
The best reward for your efforts will be your outstanding results.

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,213
Good luck!
