1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,949
In the previous lecture,
we learned about the LaTeX

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:04,170
publishing system as a whole.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,330
We discovered the principles
of working in this system,

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,610
the main concepts and the structure of source files.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,510
In this lecture, we will continue to learn
about the LaTeX system by studying a set of

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,320
system by studying a set of formulas,
adding pictures and composing tables.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,140
As mentioned in the previous
lecture, the source file contains

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,520
a preamble in
which packages are

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,820
declared depending
on their functionality.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,520
If the document contains
a large number of formulas,

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,640
it would be advised to download
the following two packages.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,830
The LaTeX system has a
number of different ways

13
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,110
to set formulas. Taking

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,660
this into account, we will
learn the main ones.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,920
The first set of formulas
can be included in a text

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,260
or shown in
a separate line.

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,770
In the first case they
are separated on both sides

18
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,390
by a single dollar sign.
In the second case they are

19
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,390
separated with a double dollar sign.

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,930
Notice that formulas are
considered mathematical

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,220
notations, including individual
variables and symbols

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,940
within the text.

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,420
Second set of formulas
can be numbered and

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,970
unnumbered. Numbered

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,890
formulas are set using
the equation environment.

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,090
Pay close attention to the presence
of a name inside this environment.

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,240
Later on, this formula can
be referenced using the

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,830
\ref{} command with
a special label.

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,490
Unnumbered formulas can
be indicated by using

30
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,580
the aforementioned double
dollar sign or the same equation

31
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,220
environment by adding an
asterisk at the end of

32
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,220
a name.

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,159
It is necessary to
disable numbering.

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,700
The third is used to
obtain a sequence of formulas

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,740
using various sets that differ
in the way the formulas

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,580
are aligned with each other.
Let us take the eqnarray

37
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,870
environment as an example.

38
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,830
Ampersands are necessary
for aligning formulas

39
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,530
by a certain sign (in
this case, an equal sign).

40
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,710
Double backslash is responsible
for transferring to a new line.

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,150
Note that there are
alternative ways

42
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,409
to set up the same formula.

43
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,030
For example, an alignment of
formulas can also be indicated

44
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,740
by an align
environment.

45
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,060
Here ampersands can be used
to achieve more complex

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,299
formula alignment
with each other.

47
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,890
Adding an asterisk in the
end of both environments

48
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,679
will disable numbering.

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,069
You can also
disable numbering

50
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,349
by adding
the \nonumber

51
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,349
command to the sequence.
As for the mathematical

52
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,010
operators and
symbols themselves.

53
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,910
In the LaTeX system,
you can type

54
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,489
any existing operator.

55
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,409
During your first steps we
recommend to use guidelines

56
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,129
that are widely represented
on the internet.

57
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,580
Here are a few
examples of the most

58
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,580
common cases.

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,629
Subscripts and superscripts
are indicated by using the

60
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,459
underscore character and circumflex.

61
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,650
These commands, by
default, are applied only

62
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,230
to single characters.

63
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,579
If you need to specify
an index of several symbols

64
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,590
then it must be
enclosed in braces.

65
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,260
Fractions are recorded
using a slash

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,950
or the \frac{}{} command
with required arguments

67
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,719
that correspond to the
numerator and denominator.

68
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,239
The superscript is written
using the corresponding

69
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,719
commands before variables.

70
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,189
Let’s revise a few examples.
The height of brackets can

71
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,849
be adapted to the content
inside by using the

72
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,510
commands \left( and \right).
If only one bracket

73
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,870
(left or right) is needed, the
second one must be balanced

74
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,559
with a null bracket in the
\left. or \right command.

75
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,799
The square root is written
by using the \sqrt{} command.

76
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,010
In addition, an optional
argument can be specified 

77
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,150
between the command name and
braces  to display the

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,180
degree of the root.

79
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,579
Matrixes are defined using
bmatrix, pmatrix and vmatrix

80
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,689
environments using square,
round and straight brackets,

81
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:36,689
respectively.

82
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,019
Sometimes, it is useful to use
an array without brackets with

83
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,260
the array environment.

84
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,469
Notice the required argument
{rcl}, which determines

85
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,279
the number of columns and
their horizontal alignment

86
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,629
(in this case,
three columns

87
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,230
aligned to the right,
center and left).

88
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,040
In the LaTeX system, it is possible
to use trigonometric operators,

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
logarithms, limits, integrals,
partial differentiation, lowercase

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,089
and uppercase letters of
the Greek alphabet, among

91
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,189
others.

92
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,609
You can also create
your own operators

93
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,409
using the following command
with two mandatory arguments,

94
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,810
the first one being the command and
the second one being the operator.

95
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,760
As a task, try typing
different types of formulas in

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,780
LaTeX (included, taken out,
numbered and not numbered),

97
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,700
which are inherent to
your professional field.

98
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,290
For example, like this.

99
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,970
Let’s move on to adding
pictures in the LaTeX system.

100
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,990
For this, it is necessary to
download the following package.

101
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,400
Figures are added using
the following construction.

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,320
In the figure environment there is
an optional argument that determines

103
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,030
the location of the figure
on a page (t corresponds

104
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,010
to the location at the top
of the page, b - at the

105
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,010
bottom parts of the page, p - on a
separate page, h - at the same place

106
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,200
where it is declared
in the source file).

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,030
The center environment is
necessary for content alignment

108
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,920
surroundings in the center.

109
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,870
The required argument of
the \includegraphics command

110
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,130
is the name of the image
file, if it is located 

111
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,930
in the same folder, as the source
file or the path to the file

112
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,870
in case it is
in a subfolder.

113
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,880
An optional argument determines
the size of the figure

114
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,970
(width or height), which
can be set as an absolute

115
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,220
value or relative
to the length lines.

116
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,280
The \caption{} command sets
the caption below the figure.

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,030
Links to the figure are
carried out by using the

118
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,470
фppropriate mark in a way that
is already familiar to us.

119
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,670
When adding a vector image
in eps format, it is necessary

120
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,120
to enable the epstopdf package,
which provides preliminary

121
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,580
conversion of the eps file to pdf.

122
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,160
Adding tables is carried
out in a similar method

123
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,130
by using the following construction.

124
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,970
The table environment
has the same optional

125
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,270
argument as the figure
environment to determine

126
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,900
the location of the table on the page.

127
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,970
The tabular environment requires
an argument that determines

128
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,090
the number of columns,
alignment settings and

129
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,960
presence of vertical
boundaries of the barrels.

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,420
Horizontal boundaries in the
table are drawn using the

131
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,540
\hline command.

132
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,190
At the end of this
lesson, practice

133
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,620
adding charts, diagrams,
raster and vector figures

134
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,090
in tex file. As well
as in the preparation

135
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,090
of tables according to the
example above. In the next

136
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,640
lecture we will consider
a number of useful options

137
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,010
that will be an advantage to know,
while working with the system.
