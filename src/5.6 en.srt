1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Good afternoon!

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,220
My name is Yulia Manaeva.

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,660
I’m teaching a course

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,780
called Effective Team Management

5
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,920
at ITMO University.

6
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,880
Today we are going to discuss public speaking skills.

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,500
Right now you might have assumed

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,720
that you’ll encounter public speaking very rarely

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,240
or not at all in your career.

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,260
But that is not true,

11
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,480
because every time we are trying

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,240
to communicate an idea to a group of people,

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,000
we are actually taking a role

14
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,040
of a public speaker at that moment.

15
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,600
So, if at some point in the future

16
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,740
you are asked to say a toast

17
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,740
during your parents’ anniversary,

18
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,120
or to ask your employer for a raise,

19
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
you’ll have to rely

20
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,120
on your public speaking skills.

21
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,140
So, if you are doing a public talk,

22
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,500
how do you start preparing for it?

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,560
Do you start with listing the contents of your talk?

24
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,280
Actually, no.

25
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,520
No need to reach

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
for your laptops and notebooks for now.

27
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Content of the talk is an important part,

28
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,580
but not the one to start your preparation with.

29
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,180
A good starting point

30
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,180
would be asking yourself: Why?

31
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,180
Why am I giving this talk?

32
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,820
What will change after it?

33
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,220
? In other words:

34
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,220
What goal am I trying to achieve with this talk?

35
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,640
An answer to this question

36
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,160
will help you to choose the style of your talk.

37
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
There are a lot of different styles,

38
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
but I’m going to focus on just one of them.

39
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,360
For example, there are motivational talks

40
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,120
and exposing talks

41
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,580
which are politicians’ favorite genre.

42
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,620
There're manifestos with philosophical postulates,

43
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,100
gratitude speeches, ceremonial speeches,

44
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,740
that, for example, may serve as entertainment

45
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,080
if spoken at a party.

46
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,420
At last, there is a persuasive speech

47
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,360
and its goal is to fully convince listeners

48
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,300
with your thesis.

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,980
But don’t make the mistake

50
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,000
of making just an informing speech.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
There are a lot of information sources

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,780
surrounding us nowadays,

53
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,280
Attending a talk just to get information

54
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,520
is not a very effective way to get some information.

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
That’s why you have to make it

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,080
a bit more difficult for yourself

57
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,200
by setting a goal of getting at least some people

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,080
to read more about the topic on their own

59
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,780
after listening to your speech.

60
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,220
Or as an alternative you can show

61
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,520
how a very difficult topic can be structured

62
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,880
and distilled to its core,

63
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,160
so that it becomes accessible to an untrained listener.

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,880
In other words, if you select the right goal,

65
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
your speech will be powerful

66
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,780
and will have a direction,

67
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
and these are the most important things

68
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,860
for a public speaker!

69
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,140
Well, now you know the goal of your speech!

70
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,760
But that is still not enough

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,260
to go to the contents.

72
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,240
The next question

73
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,580
you have to answer is: Who?

74
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,980
Who are the people

75
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,180
that will be listening to you tomorrow

76
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,920
or in the next few days?

77
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,920
It is good to know your audience’s

78
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,280
average age and profession

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
as well as to what extent

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
they are proficient in your topic

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,460
and the level of their interest in you as a speaker.

82
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,220
You need to take into account

83
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,620
historical, national and ethnic details.

84
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,620
In order to make sure that the jokes

85
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,620
you have chosen and the events

86
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,960
events you are going to mention

87
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
would be perceived adequately.

88
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
It is also nice to know

89
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,680
the time of the day

90
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,920
when your speech is scheduled.

91
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,660
Because the audience in the morning

92
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,240
or after a hearty lunch, or tired audience

93
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
in the very end of a business event

94
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,540
are three different audiences.

95
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,620
However, you need to make sure

96
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,620
you do everything to switch the audience’s attention

97
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,800
from their inner processes to you.

98
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,100
So, now you know the purpose

99
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,360
of your presentation and your audience.

100
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,300
And we finally proceed to the content.

101
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,840
I do not recommend writing your speech

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
sentence after sentence.

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
First of all, because the written speech

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,120
is always different from oral.

105
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,540
It is a real torture to listen to a lecture

106
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,240
of a professor who reads aloud a book

107
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
instead of retelling the material with his own words.

108
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
No matter how wonderful are the citations

109
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,760
you’ve chosen, what allegories

110
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
and metaphors you’ve found,

111
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,620
there is a high probability

112
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,040
that you will be too nervous and forget all of them.

113
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,320
In this case it is more important to remember

114
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,000
the structure of your talk,

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,940
know the main points that must be mentioned.

116
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,440
You should understand what sequence of ideas

117
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,000
will bring you to your speech’s goal.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,340
If you still opt for writing your speech

119
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,980
sentence after sentence,

120
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,240
make sure that the phrases you use are simple.

121
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,300
Do not overload your sentences with participles.

122
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,420
They are hard to be spoken and understood.

123
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,500
Make sure you have an introduction,

124
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
main part and conclusion

125
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
when you have finished your talk’s draft.

126
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,040
Introduction is the very chance

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
to make a first impression

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
that is not provided to us twice.

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
That means your start should be bright,

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
confident and dynamic.

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,660
Look at the most prominent speakers of our time.

132
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
What tools do they use in order

133
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,660
to concentrate the attention on themselves?

134
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,320
You could start with a rhetoric or practical question

135
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,820
that opens a dialog with your audience.

136
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,240
For example, “Who has ever snoozed

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
their alarm clock in order to have

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
another five more minutes before finally waking up?”

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
Another good approach is using statistics.

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
The numbers always attract attention.

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,140
For example, 85% of managers confess

142
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,580
they feel lonely at work.

143
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,440
The technique, by the way, can be strengthened

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
by making the audience you story’s objects.

145
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,760
In this case you can formulate the phrase like this:

146
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,980
according to the Health Association

147
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,960
every fourth person in this room suffers from insomnia.

148
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,260
You will feel the change

149
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,620
in your audience’s energy instantly.

150
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,620
Because the majority of your listeners

151
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,600
is now really interested in what you are talking about.

152
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Different jokes, parables and life stories

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
also suitable if they take you to your speech’s goal.

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,700
You can start with self-presentation

155
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
if your personality or professional area

156
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,780
are connected to your topic.

157
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,780
You can make a promise,

158
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,340
thereby intriguing the public

159
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
Promising to take everyone

160
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,620
from point A to point B.

161
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,620
The media sources are also suitable.

162
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,240
For example, movie clips, documentaries,

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,340
audios that you could demonstrate

164
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
without making any comments.

165
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,860
This will give more tension

166
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
to what happens on the stage.

167
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,360
So now that you are sure

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,840
all the attention is yours,

169
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,420
you can proceed to the main part of your talk.

170
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
This is the part that allows you

171
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,000
to deeply study each thesis and argument

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,840
that you have prepared.

173
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,400
If this is a convincing speech,

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,420
the specialists suggest to distribute the arguments

175
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,020
supporting your main thesis as follows:

176
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,780
Start with a bright and strong argument

177
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
that would drag the audience’s attention.

178
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,780
The second argument could be a bit weaker,

179
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,560
as if it is said in order

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,880
to make the quantity of arguments larger.

181
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,920
And the third one should be

182
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,420
a very strong and emotional one,

183
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,340
the one that would prepare your audience

184
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,460
to the culmination of your speech.

185
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
There, by the way, you can summarize

186
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,500
all the arguments and formulate

187
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,080
your key idea once again.

188
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
You should do it as bright and strong

189
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
as possible for your listeners to remember it.

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,520
Then you can proceed to the conclusion.

191
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,100
The conclusion is as important

192
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,620
as the introduction.

193
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
After all, the aftertaste

194
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,820
that will remain with the audience

195
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,180
after you leave the stage depends

196
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,860
on how you finish your talk.

197
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Many methods of completing a speech

198
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,040
mirror those techniques

199
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,720
that we spoke about in the introduction.

200
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
You can ask your audience a question

201
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,440
that they would reflect on alone.

202
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
You can also finish your speech with a joke,

203
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,760
real life story, call to action, promise,

204
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
conclusion or morality.

205
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Media sources would do as well

206
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,420
a video game excerpt, an audio, documentary

207
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,600
or a movie scene that illustrates

208
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,480
what has just been said on a stage.

209
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,100
Well, looks like we have done

210
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
preparing for a public talk.

211
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
One important stage is left.

212
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,520
And this is a rehearsal!

213
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,580
Find someone to listen to you.

214
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,240
A person who is ready to tell you

215
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,340
a tactful and true feedback about how you give a talk.

216
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,340
It would be good if you manage

217
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,060
to model at least minimal degree of worry,

218
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,220
which soon you will be feeling on the stage for real.

219
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,640
Why?

220
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
The thing is, that, being overwhelmed

221
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
by our feelings and emotions,

222
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
we tend to change the way we speak

223
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,040
and instead of using those beautiful citations,

224
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
allegories and methaphors

225
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,460
we start to use filler words, awkward silence,

226
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,660
clumsily filled pauses and the “Ehhh”.

227
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,520
You need to know your enemy

228
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
in order to not let it happen!

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,220
When you have information

230
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,300
about which repetitions you tend to have,

231
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
what filler words you use mostly,

232
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,680
you will be able to pre-select the necessary phrases,

233
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,720
lexical chunks and syntactic tricks,

234
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,260
in order to hide the moments when the right word

235
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
is not in your memory.

236
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
With this the preparation

237
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,800
for the verbal part of your speech is done.

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,100
Still, there are some non-verbal aspects.

239
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,720
We are going to talk about them

240
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,640
in the next lecture.

241
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
See you soon!
