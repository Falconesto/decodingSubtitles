00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, this video lecture in the section of self-realization

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
will be dedicated to such an interesting and extremely useful phenomenon as networking.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,980
What is networking?

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,460
Those who know English will easily translate this term as "weaving networks",

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,740
networks that are  professional and useful.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,620
In fact, this process, as a whole, is what it is.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,800
Networking is a social professional activity

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,160
aimed at solving various life’s tasks

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,960
with the help of a circle of friends and acquaintances.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,880
In simple words, networking is about creating a circle of different people around you

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,860
as well as the ability to maintain a relationships with these people so

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,220
that you can always reach their advice, assistance,

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,300
promotion of ideas or projects, and valuable information.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,900
The benefits of networking are hard to underestimate.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,120
So let us talk about how to network in a right way

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,440
and what pay attention to.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,140
Let us start with considering where it is most appropriate to use it.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,740
First of all, if we are talking about creating our own professional circle of communication,

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,720
it is of course, various thematic events:

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,680
professional clubs, master-classes, scientific conferences and business training sessions,

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,640
depending on your area of interest try to choose those events

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,800
that may be of interest to you and bring together specialists from a particular area in one place.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
So, for example, if you are an IT specialist,

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,500
it makes sense for you to pay attention to and attend

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
for example,  IT-forums, conferences,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,160
where leading IT companies are represented,

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,900
open days and other open events of leading technical universities,

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,760
such as, for instance, ITMO University.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
Attending these events,

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,740
remember the basic networking rules.

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
Be open and friendly

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,820
and ready for new acquaintances,

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,500
be sure to be stocked up on business cards,

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,140
and keep them handy to build on

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,940
your new acquaintance with the exchange your contact information.

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,940
Set aside your cell phone and other gadgets for another occasion.

37
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,600
If you hide your eyes in your mobile screen,

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,520
you will hardly be able to meet the right person and start a conversation.

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,500
Usually, the vast majority of participants in professional events

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,860
are open to new acquaintances and conversations,

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,860
and that's the reason many people come for.

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,640
Therefore, you should bravely come and get to know each other

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,720
using the already acquired self-presentation skills,

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,200
which we’ve talked about in previous video lectures.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,200
Ideally networking is a mutually beneficial process.

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,340
Therefore, it is very important to remember that

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,080
while getting to know someone of interest to you,

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,220
you should in turn think about “how I could be helpful?”

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,160
and the answer to that is your short self-presentation speech.

50
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
It is sometimes called Elevator Pitch

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,060
or elevator presentation.

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,320
Your short, carefully rehearsed speech

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,920
in a limited amount of time (usually no more than 1 minute)

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,800
just the time that an elevator ride takes.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,960
The peculiarity of the presentation in the elevator is

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,460
that within 1 minute you need to tell them who you are,

57
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,540
what you do, what you are interested in,

58
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,540
and how could you be helpful for your counterpart.

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,440
Moreover, you need to choose the words in such a way

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,620
that they will be understandable and reflect the main point.

61
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,800
So you have a homework to do.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,740
Before you start a thoughtful, purposeful networking,

63
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,640
you need to prepare 3-5 short self-presentations

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,260
that you will be using when getting acquainted with people you are interested in.

65
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,240
During the conversation, remember to keep the format of a dialogue,

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,040
try to talk with your conversationalist on an equal.

67
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,760
Ask open questions, and do not go to long monologues.

68
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,300
It is important to remember that if you meet people,

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,660
take a few business cards, exchange contacts on social networks

70
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,940
and forget about it safely it will be of little use for you.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,480
You need to continue communicating with people you've recently met

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,500
so that networking will be as effective as possible.

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,420
If you have found the person you really need and interested in,

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,580
if you have properly represented yourself,

75
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,800
and you are people with common interests,

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,840
you'll always find a reason to arrange a meeting to continue the dialogue.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,400
I would like to say a few words about web networking.

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,260
It is based on six degrees of separation theory,

79
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,040
which is that all the people of the earth

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,960
familiar with each other through 5 other people.

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
This is 6 degrees of communication.

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,340
You have probably faced this theory in practice.

83
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,080
In many social networks, when you're looking at someone else's interesting profile,

84
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,700
you can see a list of mutual friends

85
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,620
through whom you can potentially meet this person.

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,860
It is this section of common friends that can be a key element of your online or web networking,

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,700
with which you can make a useful

88
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,320
and mutually beneficial acquaintance with a person you are interested in.

89
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,020
So, we can say that networking is a way of life.

90
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,700
The right environment gives motivation.

91
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,720
Other people's experience and tips significantly shorten the way

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,720
to solving your problems and achieving your goals

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,140
and the assistance you provide may bring additional dividends in the future.

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
Having learned the basic principles of networking,

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,540
using the basic skills of self-representation,

96
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,280
which my colleagues and I have shared with you in previous video lectures,

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,760
you can easily make interesting and mutually beneficial acquaintances.

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,740
Be professionals,

99
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,580
surround yourself with professionals

100
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,240
and create an interesting world around you!
