Hello, my name is Natalia Ten and I am a PhD student and a teacher at ITMO University.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Our course is completed by the seventh module called “Tools”. 

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here, as we can see, we have collected the most widespread 

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and useful tools to improve your Soft Skills.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
First of all, we will discuss presentations and public speaking.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The outcomes of your work that you are going to demonstrate on a screen in front of an audience. 

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the lecture about slides we will talk about presentation structure for science conferences

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and about how to work with its content correctly. 

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You will learn more detailed information about presentation design in the next lecture.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We will tell you how to correctly choose a font, presentation colors

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and how to catch an audience’s attention with visuals.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For instance, if you have a motivational or a sales-oriented speech.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Also, we will teach those who like unorthodox software 

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
how to make a presentation with the help of such tool as Prezi.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And of course, we will share the easiest way to make a presentation 

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
if you already have an article written on TeX. 

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Obviously, with the help of LaTeX document preparation system. 

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Besides that, we can show you an interesting instrument, 

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which will help you work with ease with an article’s bibliography -

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with the bibliography reference managing program “Mendeley”. 

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We are sure this tool will make putting together a literature list for your articles easier.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We will also tell you about clouds, more exactly, cloud data storages 

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and how cloud computing can be useful.  

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We will also introduce you to the tools for teamwork organization.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You will get to know services which help keeping all the deadlines,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
increasing team’s efficiency and productivity and tracking tasks.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We invite you to our course. Good luck!
