00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,250
 Hello.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,880
 This lecture will be devoted to scientometric indicators of journals.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,720
 First attempts to make use  of scientometrics, use 

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,400
 citations in work of scientific and research organizations

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,990
 were made in 1927, while gathering librarian collections

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,830
 of some universities.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,380
 This whole system is based on the assumption that if some

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,730
 articles are cited more often than others, they have

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,470
 better quality. And if these

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,860
 frequently cited articles get into a journal, this means that

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,530
 the quality of this journal is much higher than

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,399
 that of other journal in this subject area.

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,620
 First and the most well-knownindicator 

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,310
 that is used for journals’ evaluation 

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,420
 is Impact factor.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,261
 I want to emphasize that real Impact factor may be

17
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:50,629
 calculated only for the journals included in Web of Science system.

18
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,629
 Why?

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,350
 Because Web of Science has rights on the word 

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,800
 brand “Impact factor”, that’s why.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,860
 How is Impact factor calculated? Impact factor is a number of

22
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,440
 citations made in a particular year 

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,920
 of the articles published in this journal

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,860
 during previous two years, divided by total number of articles 

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,390
 over the same period of time. Impact factor cannot be used 

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,200
 to compare journals from different scientific areas

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,039
 because of the following reasons:

28
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,680
 - Different publication activity in different areas

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,580
 - Different number of researchers

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,670
 - And simply because of difference in frequency of documents publishing

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:33,270
 In addition to the classical Impact factor, that includes 

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,810
 information about a two-year period,

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,150
 there is so called five-year impact factor.

34
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,360
 These two indicators are in constant rivalry, trying 

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,729
 to prove which one is more accurate.

36
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,380
 In fact, the two-year Impact factor allows making operations 

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,380
 more frequently, which is logical, while the five-year one 

38
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,320
 includes more samples, and shows 

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,689
 more qualitative evaluation of a journal.

40
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,260
 In Scopus system there is CiteScore, which is

41
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,229
 Impact factor’s analog. It is calculated in exactly 

42
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,229
 the same way – it is a correlation between the citations 

43
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,580
 in a particular year and the number of articles

44
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,259
 in this journal over the previous three years.

45
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,400
 The only difference is the number of years

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,129
 that is taken for the analysis – 

47
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,860
 two years for Impact factor,

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,980
 and three years for CiteScore.

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,420
 It is important to note that both Impact factor and CiteScore

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,360
 are calculated for the previous year or the year before last.

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,709
 This is done to avoid risk of missing citations

52
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,910
 that were made during current year,

53
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,680
 but have not been indexed just yet, or have not been made

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,260
 during current calendar year.

55
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,840
 Another important indicatoris SNIP, Source normalized impact per paper.

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,340
 What does it allow to do? It helps in situations?

57
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,860
 when neither classical Impact factor nor CiteScore work,

58
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,230
 in particular it allows to compare journals from different

59
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,980
 subject areas.

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,640
 How is it possible?

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,230
 It is possible because SNIP considers size of

62
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,260
 the subject area, number of researchers

63
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,030
 working in this area, as well as potential citations,

64
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,060
 meaning the assumption on how many citations an article

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,730
 devoted to one or another issue can potentially get.

66
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,920
 Another important metrics is Eigenfactor or so called

67
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 prestige factor.

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,819
 It has the iterative model in its basis, similar to that

69
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,260
 used by Google Pagerank, created by Larry Page.

70
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,840
 As soon as you type in your retrieval request in Google,

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,750
 the links get arranged in certain order:

72
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,170
 first ones are considered to be the most reliable,

73
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,700
 popular or prestigious. If we imagine it as

74
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,670
 a comprehensible model,

75
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,239
 it would work the following way: if your article was cited

76
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,860
 in Nature and in some random journal of

77
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,960
 a regional university,  he former citation would

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,110
 weight way more.

79
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,410
 It might weight hundred or even thousand times more.

80
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,629
 SJR is calculated on the basis of Scopus databases,

81
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:07,250
 and has its own portal that shows ranking of all journals

82
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,060
 included in Scopus, as well

83
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,189
 as rakings of countries, universities

84
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,530
 and even separate research groups.

85
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,381
 Not only SJR is published on a  separate portal where you can

86
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:22,090
 find rankings of journals, countries and universities,

87
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,310
 evaluated on the basis of

88
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,180
 this indicator, it is also used for determination of 

89
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,009
 journals’ quartile. There are four journal quartile

90
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,650
 s in Scopus and Web of Science The most well-known and popular

91
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,919
 articles are published in the first quartile, 

92
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,520
 while the least popular ones - in the fourth quartile respectively.

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,460
 In Scopus system we would use CiteScore for this ranking,

94
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,950
 while in Web of Science

95
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,150
 we would use Impact factor for this.

96
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,680
 In addition to classical indicators,

97
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,990
 there are several alternative ones, so called “alt metrics”.

98
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,009
 In fact, they are references to a scientific work,

99
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,650
 published in a scientific journal, but references made

100
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,759
 in popular public and political media, or in social networks, 

101
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,360
 such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and what not.

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,601
 In this context, there is such an interesting thing 

103
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,350
 as NY Times scientific citation index.

104
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,070
 When in Sunday scientific column of NY Times

105
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,259
 the review on a scientific research is published,

106
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,610
 its scientometric indicators  ise considerably, which confirms 

107
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,320
 that public interest to one or another scientific issue,

108
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
 one or another scientific article,

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,949
 may have serious influence  on academia and career of 

110
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,802
 an individual scientist. Nonetheless, in spite of

111
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,860
 the fact that scientometric indicators are relatively

112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,460
 established procedure for evaluation of scientific work,

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,410
 potential of a research, as well as career of individual 

114
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,860
 scientists, one should use them with great caution, and

115
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,039
 remember that citation indicators, H-indices, and impact factors

116
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,960
 do not always give an accurate evaluation of

117
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,020
 a work’s quality.
