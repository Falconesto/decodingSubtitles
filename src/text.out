00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Hello, my name is Anton Gopka.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,000
I am the Dean of Faculty of Technological Management and Innovations at ITMO.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we will discuss commercialization of innovations and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,300
results of your intellectual activity.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:35,900
In the beginning, I would like to say that, unfortunately, in your career you would always have to make decisions.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,900
You have to choose what you are going to do in your life.

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,400
If you do intellectual activity, you may have many roles.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,000
However, on a basic level you should distinguish between two paths:

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,200
either you are a researcher, or you do commercialization, and hence you are an entrepreneur or an investor,

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,400
and it is completely different set of roles and a different business.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,200
This is why, unfortunately, so many people just cannot sort themselves out or,

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,400
if we speak about the researchers, cannot find those teams that they would trust to commercialize,

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,600
finalize, and launch their inventions and results of their research on the market.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,500
So you as a researcher can be directly involved for decades in, say, one mechanism of action,

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,600
one phenomenon, and be the best researcher in the world.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,800
If you are lucky and you make some big discovery, you get awards,

17
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:46,400
you do publications, that is the essence of your activity and what you do.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,100
And when we, as investors, search for scientific consultants who would help us to understand the project,

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,200
we search for not just a person, but the one who devoted 10-20 years

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,800
to this or that mechanism of action, this is who we look for.

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,700
Because this very person has comprehensive and solid information

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,100
about the project or the invention that we consider.

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:21,800
But if you are not ready to spend 10-20 years on one invention or one research,

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,300
and you have decided to do commercialization, you should understand that you will have to sacrifice

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:37,500
most part of your scientific career, and you will be very unlikely to combine career

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,000
as a real scientist and a professional entrepreneur at the same time.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,900
Because an entrepreneur does different things, such as raising funds, building the strategy,

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,700
gathering a team that will later do the development, usually very basic development,

29
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:04,500
then will launch the invention to the market, possibly trading-off quality from the scientific point of view,

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,300
because they are interested in something different.

31
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,800
They make sure that the project will satisfy some need.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:22,200
And when it enters the market, and this need is tested and proved, it is you, who will have to do some improvements, amendments, and so on.

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,200
In fact, every career has its advantages and pitfalls. Meaning, if you are a scientist, you might feel uncomfortable to search for money,

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,800
or complete the abovementioned complicated and boring tasks, like gathering a team and so on.

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,600
It actually might be just very uncomfortable for you, and the point is not only about you being incompetent in this, it is just not your cup of tea.

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,400
And you should understand this, and value what you do and be happy.

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,100
On the other hand, even if you are a researcher,

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,600
you always want to know whether what you do has some practical application in industry, you often need to know this.

39
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,700
And of course, commercializers, people who do commercialization, or entrepreneurs are constantly looking for such products.

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,400
I call this process innovation archeology, such an oxymoron.

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Archeology on the one hand, and innovations on the other.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:25,500
For example, you are a researcher, and you sit in your lab, and you dig and grub, and discover some piece of something.

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,300
And what it could be used for is absolutely unknown.

44
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,100
Maybe it’s some kind of an ancient vase, or, for example, part of an animal,

45
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:45,300
or maybe some other weird object, some new material, maybe something else.

46
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,300
And you completely don’t know what it might be, because often you see a part, but you don’t see the whole picture.

47
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,100
And, unfortunately, if you are a professional scientist, as a rule, you constantly are in one and same information stream,

48
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,900
while you actually need to get into some different information stream.

49
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,500
while you actually need to get into some different information stream.

50
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,600
and also with those who work in your sector.

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Often these are angel investors, venture capital funds and industries, industrial partners.

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,200
Thus, I strongly recommend you to establish contacts with these people, because they might come to you and say:

53
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,200
“The thing you have discovered is clearly a means to detect cancer at an early stage”,

54
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,600
or it has some element that could be used in solar energetics, or it can be used, for example,

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,200
to test food quality or in agriculture, and so forth.

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,500
So, each person who will come to you is in his or her informational stream, and will listen to you describing your interesting invention,

57
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:14,000
or some new material that reflects or absorbs light differently, or some strange and unusual thing,

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,600
and from his or her perspective will unexpectedly tell you that it can be used as internet of things, as a sensor that can monitor, let’s say, failure of railcars.

59
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:30,000
This communication is very important. If we speak about such countries as the USA, for example, I have this experience:

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,800
regularly I went to the cafeteria in MIT and met scientists there, we had lunch or dinner together,

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,800
and discussed their recent inventions, their ideas, and it was very valuable and striking communication.

62
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Of course, you can organize some workshops, meet-ups, all these words, actually all these meetings are about innovation archeology.

63
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:03,000
So, if you understood that your invention makes sense and has chances to be commercialized,

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,200
it is high time to meet investors.

65
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,000
As a rule, investors are very smart people, competent in industry and your technology, if we are talking about professional investors.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Of course, they are not as competent as scientists are, but they can excellently understand

67
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,500
whether your invention has any value or not.

68
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,200
The investors are highly professional and experienced.

69
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:37,100
They have seen thousands of projects, thousands of businesses that have unfortunately failed, but they have also seen success stories,

70
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:48,000
and as a rule, they have clear understanding of the topics that they would invest in, the investment topic.

71
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,300
The investment topic is, as a rule, a clear description of risks that they deal with in every project.

72
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,100
And if you plan to turn to investors, I recommend you to check their websites in advance,

73
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,400
and read their usual investment criteria.

74
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:20,600
Generally speaking, in a nutshell, it is a list of risks that they are ready to take in this or that topic.

75
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,000
For example, if we are talking about early-stage projects, as a rule, they have very high technological risks.

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,400
This requires compromise. If technological risks are very high,

77
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:42,000
the invention should transform the whole sector and be widely applicable. For instance, it might be some kind of technological platform.

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,100
If we are talking about an invention that would not, unfortunately, transform the sector, won’t change anything,

79
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:55,900
but solves some narrow and specific problem, the technical risk should be minimal, or better should not exist at all.

80
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,500
This technology should be well thought, proved; many articles should be devoted to it,

81
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,300
everything should be clear, and in this case, such compromise is possible.

82
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:16,500
You should understand these compromises very well, and understand what type of invention you have,

83
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,000
and if you plan to work with investors, you should find those, who are interested in what you do.

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,500
I strongly warn you against presenting your projects to those, who do not work with your topics,

85
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,100
you should not try to re-position your invention or pretend that it meets their interests if it does not,

86
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
or present your project as a mature one if it is actually at early stage.

87
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,200
It can be checked easily, and any serious investor always checks projects with other scientists,

88
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,300
and if you made such mistake, you are unlikely to build any long-term relationships in the future.

89
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,000
Thus, before trying to commercialize something I recommend you to decide explicitly

90
00:09:58,000 --> 00:01:03,300
whether you want to be a researcher or commercializer, an entrepreneur.

91
00:01:03,300 --> 00:10:11,100
In addition, regardless your decision, I strongly recommend you to build the network of contacts

92
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,700
that will help you to understand whether you generally can commercialize your idea or invention, or not.

93
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:28,600
And finally, in any role you may become a co-founder of a project, or a company, or a business.

94
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:36,900
You should make a list of investors who would consider your invention as relevant

95
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:43,700
and meet them one after another, send emails, contact them, but this is already a role of entrepreneur.

96
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
Thank you.

97
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,499
In the next lecture I will tell you what investors expect, and what they want to hear.
