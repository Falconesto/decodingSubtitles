00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Hello, this video lecture in the section of self-realization

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,360
will be dedicated to such an interesting and extremely useful phenomenon as networking.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,980
What is networking?

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,460
Those who know English will easily translate this term as "weaving networks",

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,740
networks that are  professional and useful.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,620
In fact, this process, as a whole, is what it is.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,800
Networking is a social professional activity

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,160
aimed at solving various life’s tasks

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,960
with the help of a circle of friends and acquaintances.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,880
In simple words, networking is about creating a circle of different people around you

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,860
as well as the ability to maintain a relationships with these people so

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,220
that you can always reach their advice, assistance,

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,300
promotion of ideas or projects, and valuable information.

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,900
The benefits of networking are hard to underestimate.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,120
So let us talk about how to network in a right way

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,440
and what pay attention to.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,140
Let us start with considering where it is most appropriate to use it.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,740
First of all, if we are talking about creating our own professional circle of communication,

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,720
it is of course, various thematic events:

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,680
professional clubs, master-classes, scientific conferences and business training sessions,

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,640
depending on your area of interest try to choose those events

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,800
that may be of interest to you and bring together specialists from a particular area in one place.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,040
So, for example, if you are an IT specialist,

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,500
it makes sense for you to pay attention to and attend

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
for example,  IT-forums, conferences,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,160
where leading IT companies are represented,

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,900
open days and other open events of leading technical universities,

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,760
such as, for instance, ITMO University.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
Attending these events,

30
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,740
remember the basic networking rules.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Be open and friendly

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,820
and ready for new acquaintances,

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,500
be sure to be stocked up on business cards,

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,140
and keep them handy to build on

35
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,940
your new acquaintance with the exchange your contact information.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,940
Set aside your cell phone and other gadgets for another occasion.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,600
If you hide your eyes in your mobile screen,

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,520
you will hardly be able to meet the right person and start a conversation.

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,500
Usually, the vast majority of participants in professional events

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,860
are open to new acquaintances and conversations,

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
and that's the reason many people come for.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,640
Therefore, you should bravely come and get to know each other

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,720
using the already acquired self-presentation skills,

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,200
which we’ve talked about in previous video lectures.

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,200
Ideally networking is a mutually beneficial process.

46
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,340
Therefore, it is very important to remember that

47
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,080
while getting to know someone of interest to you,

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,220
you should in turn think about “how I could be helpful?”

49
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,160
and the answer to that is your short self-presentation speech.

50
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
It is sometimes called Elevator Pitch

51
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,060
or elevator presentation.

52
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,320
Your short, carefully rehearsed speech

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,920
in a limited amount of time (usually no more than 1 minute)

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,800
just the time that an elevator ride takes.

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,960
The peculiarity of the presentation in the elevator is

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,460
that within 1 minute you need to tell them who you are,

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,540
what you do, what you are interested in,

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,540
and how could you be helpful for your counterpart.

59
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,440
Moreover, you need to choose the words in such a way

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,620
that they will be understandable and reflect the main point.

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,800
So you have a homework to do.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,740
Before you start a thoughtful, purposeful networking,

63
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,640
you need to prepare 3-5 short self-presentations

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,260
that you will be using when getting acquainted with people you are interested in.

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,240
During the conversation, remember to keep the format of a dialogue,

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,040
try to talk with your conversationalist on an equal.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,760
Ask open questions, and do not go to long monologues.

68
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
It is important to remember that if you meet people,

69
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,660
take a few business cards, exchange contacts on social networks

70
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,940
and forget about it safely it will be of little use for you.

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,480
You need to continue communicating with people you've recently met

72
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,500
so that networking will be as effective as possible.

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,420
If you have found the person you really need and interested in,

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,580
if you have properly represented yourself,

75
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,800
and you are people with common interests,

76
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,840
you'll always find a reason to arrange a meeting to continue the dialogue.

77
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,400
I would like to say a few words about web networking.

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,260
It is based on six degrees of separation theory,

79
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,040
which is that all the people of the earth

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,960
familiar with each other through 5 other people.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
This is 6 degrees of communication.

82
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,340
You have probably faced this theory in practice.

83
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,080
In many social networks, when you're looking at someone else's interesting profile,

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,700
you can see a list of mutual friends

85
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,620
through whom you can potentially meet this person.

86
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,860
It is this section of common friends that can be a key element of your online or web networking,

87
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,700
with which you can make a useful

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,320
and mutually beneficial acquaintance with a person you are interested in.

89
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,020
So, we can say that networking is a way of life.

90
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,700
The right environment gives motivation.

91
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,720
Other people's experience and tips significantly shorten the way

92
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,720
to solving your problems and achieving your goals

93
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,140
and the assistance you provide may bring additional dividends in the future.

94
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Having learned the basic principles of networking,

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,540
using the basic skills of self-representation,

96
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,280
which my colleagues and I have shared with you in previous video lectures,

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,760
you can easily make interesting and mutually beneficial acquaintances.

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,740
Be professionals,

99
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,580
surround yourself with professionals

100
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,240
and create an interesting world around you!
